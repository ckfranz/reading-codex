Nynaeve has developed feelings for [Lan Mandragoran](#al-Lan-Mandragoran), [Moiraine](#Moiraine-Damodred)'s Warder, and he shares those feelings despite his insistence that it is inappropriate and dangerous to act on them. Nynaeve blames Moiraine herself for disrupting her village's life and endangering the lives of the four people she spirited away when the Trollocs attacked Emond's Field.

Her study is famous in the Tower, both as a place of sanctuary when the stress of novice (or Accepted) life becomes too great to bear alone and as a place of punishment when an initiate steps out of line."
