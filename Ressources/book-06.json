The Seat is traditionally held by a woman strong both in the Power and in her character. The vote to choose an Amyrlin must be unanimous, as must the vote to depose one. Once chosen the Amyrlin is said to be “of all Ajahs and none”—all previous affiliations with Ajah are ignored (at least in theory). The Ajahs get fairly equal numbers of Amyrlins raised from their Ajah, with two exceptions: no Amyrlin has been raised from the Red Ajah since Bonwhin, who was deposed and stilled for nearly breaking the Tower in [Artur Hawkwing](#Artur-Hawkwing)'s day, except for [Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan](#Elaida-do-Avriny-a-Roihan), the current Amyrlin Seat in Tar Valon; the Blue Ajah has had more than the average number of Amyrlins from its Ajah—four of the last the last five Amyrlins (before Elaida) were raised from the Blue Ajah. These two exceptions to the mean number of Amyrlins from one's Ajah have only added to the friction between the Blue and Red Ajahs over the years. The Amyrlin has a secretary of sorts, the [Keeper of the Chronicles](#Keeper-of-the-Chronicles), who is traditionally chosen from the same Ajah that the Amyrlin was raised from. The office was held by [Siuan Sanche](#Siuan-Sanche), raised from the Blue Ajah, until she was deposed for her involvement with events surrounding the [Dragon Reborn](#Dragon-Reborn). Her successor was the leader of the coup, Elaida, raised from the Red Ajah. Siuan's deposition divided the Tower, and the faction opposing Elaida plans to raise its own Amyrlin."

She served as advisor to [Queen Morgase](#Morgase-Trakand) of Andor for her entire reign, and led the coup that deposed [Siuan Sanche](#Siuan-Sanche) and placed her on the Amyrlin Seat in her place. She distrusts anyone not of the Red Ajah (as most Reds do), and thinks she will never trust any member of the Blue Ajah again, even in the slightest. Her [Keeper of the Chronicles](#Keeper-of-the-Chronicles) is [Alviarin Freidhen](#Alviarin-Freidhen) of the White Ajah—she was all but forced to choose Alviarin due to her role in the deposition of Siuan. If she chose a Keeper from her Ajah, she most likely would not have won the support of the White Ajah, and then _she_ would have been stilled and banished from the Tower instead of Siuan. She sometimes has the Foretelling, but not all that often or that strongly. One of her Foretellings was that the Royal Family of Andor would play a crucial role in the Last Battle—this Foretelling occurred around the time the Succession was going on, so she immediately attached herself to Morgase as soon as it became clear that she would be the one to take the Lion Throne. Another was to predict that [Rand al'Thor](#Rand-al-Thor) would shake the world on its very foundations—she constantly kicks herself for not doing something about him when he was in front of her, little more than a farmboy at the time. The Foretelling about Rand is obviously deadly accurate, but the one about the Royal Family occurred at an inopportune time; at the time of Elaida's Foretelling, the Royal Family was not certain. It may have meant Morgase, [Gawyn](#Gawyn-Trakand), [Galad](#Galadedrid-Galad-Damodred), and [Elayne](#Elayne-Trakand) (they have all had a large role to play in the recent past), but it is also possible it could have meant the old Royal Family, that of [Tigraine](#Lady-Tigraine-Mantear), [Taringail](#Lord-Taringail-Damodred), Galad, and later Elayne and Gawyn as well. After all, Morgase is just Morgase, but Tigraine is the mother of the Dragon Reborn. Elaida is quite strong in the One Power; only Siuan, [Moiraine](#Moiraine-Damodred), [Egwene](#Egwene-al-Vere), [Elayne](#Elayne-Trakand), [Nynaeve](#Nynaeve-al-Meara), and a few others can match her strength."

During the chaos that erupted after [Siuan Sanche](#Siuan-Sanche)'s deposition, Gawyn formed a band of young men, everyone who had trained with the Warders except Galad, who are called the Younglings. The Younglings fought back against their teachers, who were trying to free Siuan and [Leane](#Leane-Sharif) from their imprisonment. Gawyn himself killed Hammar and Coulin, the men in charge of teaching the sword and for his personal training, respectively, both of which are Blademasters—few Warders are as good as they were, and Gawyn managed to kill both of them. Gawyn does not know which party to support—he believes that anyone who opposes Tower Law by trying to free Siuan and Leane is wrong, but at the same time he does not know all the facts surrounding the change in leadership. In fact, his sister Elayne and her friends [Nynaeve al'Meara](#Nynaeve-al-Meara) and [Egwene al'Vere](#Egwene-al-Vere) side with those who broke from the Tower.

He was never really bound inside the Bore, and led the hidden forces of the Shadow for the three thousand odd years from the end of the War of the Shadow to the present. He took credit for such things as convincing the then insane [Lews Therin Telamon](#Lews-Therin-Telamon) to kill everyone he loved, pursuading the dying [Artur Hawkwing](#Artur-Hawkwing) not to accept the Aes Sedai Healing that might have saved his life, sending the Trollocs out of the Great Blight during the Trolloc Wars, and many other events in history that turned out poorly. When the rest of the Forsaken were freed, Ishamael kept them away from each other's throats. He confronted [Rand](#Rand-al-Thor) at the Eye of the World where he was severed from the [Dark One](#Dark-One)'s bonds; he confronted him again at Falme where Rand melted his sword when he put it through him, but not after Ishamael gave Rand a wound that he has not been able to recover from yet; and he confronted Rand in the Stone of Tear after he took _Callandor_. Rand killed Ishamael after beating him sore by plunging _Callandor_ into his heart. His body rotted quickly, but it was proof that [Ba'alzamon](#Ba-alzamon), which he called himself to the public, was a human being, and not the [Dark One](#Dark-One)."

She was born Mierin Eronaile, and was strong in the One Power. She worked at the Collam Daan, the primary facility for research into the One Power. Her final discovery there was what she thought was a new source for the One Power, one that could be harnessed by men and women alike—this source turned out to be the emissions through a thin spot in the Pattern from the [Dark One](#Dark-One)'s prison. She and another Aes Sedai named Beidomon bored into that prison, creating what is now referred to as simply the Bore, allowing the Dark One to touch the world again and leading to the War of the Shadow. Around this time, Mierin had a relationship with [Lews Therin Telamon](#Lews-Therin-Telamon), who headed the forces of the Light against the Shadow and was the most powerful and influential man she had found. Lews Therin broke off the relationship when he found that she only wanted him for his power and authority and the possibility of power for herself through him. Mierin never let go of him, and when he later met and married [Ilyena Moerelle](#Ilyena-Therin-Moerelle) she tried to disrupt the wedding ceremony as well as split the two apart by any means. Eventually she went to Shayol Ghul to dedicate her soul to the Shadow, most likely to get back at Lews Therin for leaving her. She declared as her territory the World of Dreams, _Tel'aran'rhiod_, using it to ends now unknown. She transferred her obsessive love intact to Lews Therin's soul's new body, [Rand al'Thor](#Rand-al-Thor), after being freed from the Bore. She first appeared to him as a young woman named Selene, disguising her appearance as a slightly less beautiful (but still stunning) woman. Almost a year later, Lanfear found that Rand had been “unfaithful” to her, and she tried to kill him.

Along with his good friends, [Rand al'Thor](#Rand-al-Thor) and [Perrin Aybara](#Perrin-t-Bashere-Aybara), he left home to escape the Trolloc attack on Winternight. On the way to Tar Valon, he picked up a dagger from Shadar Logoth tainted with the evil that destroyed Aridhol, which he carried with him for a long time. He was separated from the dagger by Aes Sedai Healing, but doing so caused large gaps in his memory sequence. These gaps were filled and more when he passed through the twisted door to the land of the Eelfinn, where he was granted his three requests: a foxhead medallion that protected him from women's channeling, a way out of the land of the Eelfinn, and the memories of past lifetimes that were the gaps in his memory. Mat's _ta'veren_ qualities manifest themselves particularly well with random events, such as dice games—he almost never loses a toss of the dice, even if the dice are weighted. He has found that battles are the ultimate form of gambling, and along with his newfound memories he can win almost every battle he fights quite decisively. He has four sisters, including [Eldrin](#Eldrin-Cauthon) and [Bodewhin](#Bodewhin-Bode-Cauthon), who are 16 and 17, respectively. His father [Abell](#Abell-Cauthon) is one of the best archers in the Two Rivers, possibly in the World. Mat has gotten in the habit of carrying concealed knives under his clothes in case he is attacked—his collection would surprise anyone. In the Waste, he met a woman named Melindhra, a Maiden of the Spear from the Shaido Clan. However, she is not the [Daughter of the Nine Moons](#Daughter-of-the-Nine-Moons), who Mat is destined to marry according to the Aelfinn; besides, she tried to kill him on orders from her master among the Darkfriends. Mat had to kill her to save his own skin, but regrets it deeply. He has a scar along his neck from where the Eelfinn tried to kill him—which was also in accordance with what the Aelfinn told him, that he is “to die and live again.” He currently heads an army called the Band of the Red Hand, after the army of King Aemon of old Manetheren, and serves in a way as Rand's personal general—this works well, since Mat seems to be a better general than even [Davram Bashere](#Lord-Davram-t-Ghaline-Bashere), who has earned his good reputation as one of the best commanders alive. Mat does not trust any Aes Sedai, and because of this refuses to take his foxhead medallion off even to bathe."

She is considered short among her people, and the Cairhienin are already a short people. When it was discovered that she had the ability to channel inborn, Moiraine went to Tar Valon to become an Aes Sedai. Just before being raised to the shawl, she and her friend [Siuan Sanche](#Siuan-Sanche) witnessed [Gitara Moroso](#Gitara-Moroso)'s Foretelling of the Rebirth of the [Dragon](#The-Dragon). Moiraine and Siuan walked away from each other and did not speak to each other again (at least in public), but both held secret communication with each other and dedicated their lives to finding and guiding the [Dragon Reborn](#Dragon-Reborn). Moiraine found the young man she sought on Winternight in Emond's Field, a young man named [Rand al'Thor](#Rand-al-Thor), along with two more _ta'veren_, [Mat Cauthon](#Matrim-Mat-Cauthon) and [Perrin Aybara](#Perrin-t-Bashere-Aybara) and two women with the spark of the Power inborn, [Egwene al'Vere](#Egwene-al-Vere) and [Nynaeve al'Meara](#Nynaeve-al-Meara). When Moiraine was shortly raised to the shawl, she met [al'Lan Mandragoran](#al-Lan-Mandragoran), the uncrowned King of Malkier, who was fighting alone against the Shadow in the Blight; she asked Lan to become her Warder, and he accepted. She is very strong in the Power, stronger than almost all living Aes Sedai. In the Stone of Tear, Moiraine confronted and killed the Forsaken [Be'lal](#Be-lal) with balefire, just before he would have killed Rand. Later, after having an inkling of the future events from the testing _ter'angreal_ for the Wise Ones, Moiraine managed to push the Forsaken [Lanfear](#Lanfear) through the twisted doorway _ter'angreal_. Other Aes Sedai consider her a legend, not only for discovering the [Dragon Reborn](#Dragon-Reborn) but for defeating two of the Forsaken as well."

The city finally turned on itself, consumed itself, tainting every grain of sand, every rock, every sip of water with its hatred. Mordeth's soul remained in the city, now called Shadar Logoth (“Where the Shadow Waits”) for millenia—he could not leave the city unless he accompanied a person to the city walls or had them carry something from the city to the outside world. Strangely enough, both of these things happened at the same time, when [Mat Cauthon](#Matrim-Mat-Cauthon) carried the ruby-handled dagger from the city while [Padan Fain](#Padan-Fain) accompanied Mordeth out of the city at about the same time. Mordeth attempted to consume Fain's soul while the dagger tried to consume Mat's. In Fain's case, the attempt to consume his soul was not completely successful—instead, the two souls merged to create something more evil than either Mordeth or Fain alone. Fain now feels incomplete without the tainted dagger that was removed from the city."

She married [Taringail Damodred](#Lord-Taringail-Damodred), a prince of Cairhien, to further solidify her claim to the Throne of Andor; when [Tigraine](#Lady-Tigraine-Mantear) disappeared, Morgase made the best claim to succeed her, and married her widower to gain the support that would be gained by such action. Taringail died when Elayne and Gawyn father; he died when they were young. Morgase has since gone through several lovers, including [Thomdril Merrilin](#Thomdril-Thom-Merrilin), a former court-bard; [Gareth Bryne](#Lord-Gareth-Bryne), her First Prince of the Sword and Captain of the Guards; and most recently [Lord Gaebril](#Lord-Gaebril), a man who led the faction that stilled the riots in Caemlyn that sprang up on Morgase's trip to Tar Valon to inquire about Elayne's whereabouts. Thom was exiled from the city of Caemlyn when he started telling her what he really thought of some of her plans, her relationship with Bryne ebbed away until finally Gaebril told her to exile him too, and Gaebril eventually chased Morgase herself out of the city when she found he was usurping her power. The Daughter-Heir of Andor is traditionally trained by Aes Sedai in the White Tower, and Morgase underwent novice training to keep the tradition alive. She was given the gift of a Great Serpent ring despite not being Accepted, and still wears it on her left hand. She was previously advised by [Elaida a'Roihan](#Elaida-do-Avriny-a-Roihan) of the Red Ajah, who is now the [Amyrlin Seat](#Amyrlin-Seat). When Morgase discovered that Gaebril meant to usurp her throne, she left, and when she learned that the [Dragon Reborn](#Dragon-Reborn) had taken over Caemlyn and none of her former supporters would give her aid, she fled to Amadicia to get help from the only place she thought she could: [Pedron Niall](#Lord-Captain-Commander-Pedron-Niall) and the Children of the Light. She is not aware that [Rand](#Rand-al-Thor) only wants to give her country back to her, not to mention believes that she is dead. If she made her presence known, she would no doubt have her country back in one piece and all would be well, but as royalty she believes she must work on her own and trust no one. The entire world believes Morgase dead except for a select few, all of which are in Amadicia at the moment."

She left when four of her villagers were taken away from the Two Rivers by [Moiraine](#Moiraine-Damodred) and [Lan](#al-Lan-Mandragoran). While the group traveled away from her home and toward her new life, Nynaeve made several discoveries: she could channel the One Power, and had already done so without really knowing what she was doing; she developed feelings for al'Lan Mandragoran, Moiraine's Warder and the uncrowned king of the now dead nation Malkier; and she has a major role to play, as all of her younger friends in the group do, in the years to come. She is very strong in the One Power; only a select few who were alive during the Age of Legends could match her. When she arrived in Tar Valon, she was raised Accepted without any tenure as a Novice, despite not being able to even _sense_ the True Source unless angry, a result of her having to learn some minimal control of her ability without teaching. She was sent on a false mission by [Liandrin](#Liandrin) on which she was almost leashed by the Seanchan as [Egwene](#Egwene-al-Vere) was. After she returned to the Tower, [Siuan Sanche](#Siuan-Sanche) sent her on a mission to hunt down Liandrin and her fellow Black Sisters; while hunting them in Tanchico, she encountered [Moghedien](#Moghedien) and managed to better her in a duel of the Power. Moghedien escaped, but two encounters later Nynaeve once again managed to get the better of her, leashing her with an _a'dam_ in _Tel'aran'rhiod_. Nynaeve took Moghedien with her to seek out [Rand](#Rand-al-Thor) and [Rahvin](#Rahvin) while they were fighting each other, and at the last moment before Rahvin might have won, she nearly burned Rahvin to ash with a giant weave of fire that was most of what Moghedien could draw to produce it; the distraction was enough for Rand to regain control of himself and destroy Rahvin with balefire. Nynaeve now keeps Moghedien under control with a modified _a'dam_ in Salidar. Nynaeve wishes to become Aes Sedai for the sole purpose of Healing; she thinks the Tower meddles in the affairs of nations far too much, and wants no part of it. She is determined to Heal anything short of death, from severing to the wound on Rand's side. Nynaeve felt bad when [Moiraine](#Moiraine-Damodred) died, because her first thought was not of her, but that now Lan was free from their bond. She was not told that Lan's bond had been passed to another at the moment of her death, or who that person is."

His real parents, however, were [Janduin](#Janduin), the chief of the Taardad Aiel who brought the four clans across the Dragonwall to punish [Laman](#King-Laman-Damodred)'s Sin, and a Maiden of the Spear named [Shaiel](#Shaiel), who was actually [Tigraine Mantear](#Lady-Tigraine-Mantear), the runaway Daughter-Heir of Andor. Tigraine gave birth to Rand on the slopes of Dragonmount, in accordance with prophecy; “born of a Maiden, of the ancient blood but raised by the Old.” Rand has a heron branded into each of his palms, which he received from the sword Tam gave him while fighting [Ishamael](#Ishamael). He also has two dragons on his forearms, which he recieved in Rhuidean to designate him as the [Car'a'carn](#Car-a-carn), the Chief of Chiefs of the Aiel. He is not only the Dragon Reborn, but also [He Who Comes With the Dawn](#He-Who-Comes-With-the-Dawn), the man prophesied to reunite the Aiel, and the [Coramoor](#Coramoor), the one prophesied to bring the Sea Folk out of the Sea. He can channel strongly, more so than any person who ever lived (except the previous user of his soul, [Lews Therin Telamon](#Lews-Therin-Telamon), who was obviously of equal strength), and is also _ta'veren_, the most strongly so since Lews Therin as well. Lews Therin's voice has somehow found a new place inside of Rand's head; he talks to him in a mad voice when Rand least expects it, sometimes offering sound advice or knowledge, sometimes babbling, sometimes even trying to wrest control of _saidin_ from him. Unlike Lews Therin, Rand is accompanied by two other _ta'veren_ during this turing of the Wheel, two men born within days (hours, even) of him named [Matrim Cauthon](#Matrim-Mat-Cauthon) and [Perrin Aybara](#Perrin-t-Bashere-Aybara), who both grew up in Emond's Field as well. Rand is destined to fall in love with three women (and has): [Min Farshaw](#Elmindreda-Min-Farshaw), [Elayne Trakand](#Elayne-Trakand), and [Aviendha](#Aviendha). He has already been born on the slopes of Dragonmount of a Maiden, of the ancient blood but raised by the old, taken the Stone of Tear and drawn _Callandor_, and began conquering “under the forgotten symbol,” that of the Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends. He is working on having the “spotless tower” break and bend knee to him, as well. He is the salvation of the entire world, and as the prophecy states, he _will_ save the world—and Break it again."

This hole, called the Bore, allowed the Dark One to once again touch the world, causing new outbreaks of war, treachery, violence, and crime. The attempt to free the Dark One completely resulted in the War of the Shadow (called the War of Power by some, especially those on the Shadow's side), during which a number of important leaders forsook the Light and gave their lives to the Dark One; these people are known today as the Forsaken, and were 13 of the most powerful Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends. The War of the Shadow did not end until [Lews Therin Telamon](#Lews-Therin-Telamon), the Dragon, and his Hundred Companions Traveled to Shayol Ghul and re-sealed the Dark One back into his prison. At the moment of sealing, Shai'tan lashed out at those sealing the prison, driving them insane and tainting _saidin_ itself, the male half of the True Source, dooming all male Aes Sedai to madness as well and starting the Time of Madness. These seals are weakening now, enough that the Forsaken have escaped and the Dark One is once again able to exert influence on the world. These seals were scattered throughout the world by Aes Sedai during the Breaking of the World. In order of when they were found, they were placed: (1) At the Eye of the World (broken when it was found); (2) in the hands of Bayle Domon, later pilfered by High Lord Turak of the Seanchan (broke at the battle of Falme), (3) On Seanchan, part of High Lord Turak's collection (broken at the battle at Falme); (4) In the Great Hold at the Stone of Tear (still intact); (5) In the Panarch's Palace in Tanchico (broke enroute to Salidar); (6) One in Rhuidean (still intact), and (7) Found by [Mazrim Taim](#Mazrim-Taim) (still intact).

When her lifelong connection to the [Dragon Reborn](#Dragon-Reborn) was discovered, she and her [Keeper of the Chronicles](#Keeper-of-the-Chronicles), [Leane Sharif](#Leane-Sharif), were deposed and stilled by a group of sisters loyal to [Elaida a'Roihan](#Elaida-do-Avriny-a-Roihan). Siuan hopes to regain some of her previous standing in the new Tower that has separated from Elaida—her knowledge of the Blue Ajah spy network is hard to match, and she knows much that she thinks would be of use. In one of her viewings, [Min](#Elmindreda-Min-Farshaw) saw that Siuan would have to remain close by to [Gareth Bryne](#Lord-Gareth-Bryne)—if she did not, both of them would die. Siuan did not initially know what she meant, but now realizes that she is growing to love the gray-haired man who leads the Salidar army. She had a Warder named [Alric](#Alric), but he died when she was deposed."

    "info": "The uncrowned king of Malkier, and formerly Warder to [Moiraine](#Moiraine-Damodred). He is quite tall, and does not get very emotional—in fact, he has emotional walls all around him that he has been building for years. His country, Malkier, was overrun by Trollocs shortly after he was born, and is now corrupted by the Great Blight. Lan, the last of his people, then proceeded to fight a one-man war against the Shadow by killing Shadowspawn in the Blight. He fought Aiel during the Aiel War, and achieved Blademaster status. He was eventually bonded by Moiraine, which ended his lonely fight (or at least changed its style). When Lan and Moiraine brought [Rand](#Rand-al-Thor), [Mat](#Matrim-Mat-Cauthon), [Perrin](#Perrin-t-Bashere-Aybara), [Egwene](#Egwene-al-Vere), and [Nynaeve](#Nynaeve-al-Meara) out of their home in the Two Rivers, he found that there was something which could throw his guard down, but he was the last to notice it: affection for Nynaeve. As Moiraine put it, Nynaeve was able to plant vines in Lan's emotional walls and break them down without him even knowing they were there. He loves her very much, whether he admits it openly or not, and Nynaeve, to her surprise, loves him in return. Upon Moiraine's death, Lan's bond was immediately transferred to another Aes Sedai, and he was last seen leaving the wagons near Cairhien to seek her out."
