Some of the other Forsaken think he was insane, for only someone insane would create some of the creatures he did. He was the second one to be released from the sealing on the Bore, after Balthamel. He was trapped close to the surface of the Bore, so he was not shielded from the passing of time very effectively; he emerged as a very old man, so old that his face was wrinkled so that one could barely make out his features anymore. He was killed by [Rand](#Rand-al-Thor) at the Eye of the World. Unbeknownst to almost everyone (including the Forsaken), Aginor was reincarnated in the body of a Borderlander man and given the new name Osan'gar. Osan'gar masqueraded as Corlan Dashiva, one of the Asha'man, until he was killed at the cleansing of _saidin_ by Elza Penfell and her circle.

She served as [Keeper of the Chronicles](#Keeper-of-the-Chronicles) under [Elaida](#Elaida-do-Avriny-a-Roihan), despite being of a different Ajah than Elaida was raised from. Elaida was all but forced to choose Alviarin in order to gain the support of the White Ajah when bringing charges against [Siuan](#Siuan-Sanche); unknown to Elaida, this also brought her the support of the Black Ajah. Without Alviarin as Keeper, the White Ajah would most likely have been divided over whether to depose Siuan, and only the Red would be behind Elaida, which would most likely have led to the stilling of Elaida and possibly even the dismantling of the Red Ajah. It still may, since Elaida is rapidly losing her support among the sisters. If Alviarin's loyalties are ever revealed, it is likely nothing will save either of them. Alviarin has been shown how to Travel by [Mesaana](#Mesaana), and one of her first uses of it brought her to Tremalking for several weeks, during which Elaida removed her as Keeper. She appeared to know that the Aes Sedai sent back from Salidar were spies; she refused to let Elaida speak with Meidani, who was one of them.

Her spears were melted down into other objects, which themselves could not be weapons, to be given away as gifts to the people she hated most—the metal from one spear is now used in a belt buckle for [Rand al'Thor](#Rand-al-Thor). She has green eyes, and is of age with Rand and [Mat](#Matrim-Mat-Cauthon). She is more than pretty with her dark reddish hair. Aviendha is one of the three women in [Min](#Elmindreda-Min-Farshaw)'s viewing of Rand—she also saw that she was to fall in love with him when she went through the three rings in Rhuidean. She denied her feelings for him at first, but when the wagons crossed the Dragonwall toward Cairhien, sweat tents became unavailable and she tried bathing as “wetlanders” did; Rand came in as she was standing before the bath in her skin, and she panicked. She created a Traveling gateway to southern Seanchan (she does not remember how), trying to get as far away from Rand as possible, into the middle of winter. When Rand rescued her, she decided she could not hide her feelings any longer, and the two ended up spending the night in each other's arms before coming back. Aviendha says a similar incident will not occur, and punished any Maiden who made a crack about it (how they found out about something that occurred on the far side of the world on another continent is a different subject entirely). She felt _toh_ toward [Elayne](#Queen-Elayne-Trakand) for violating her trust, but upon hearing that Elayne would consent to being her sister-wife, Aviendha felt empowered to show her feelings for Rand once again. She is not certain what she thinks of a _second_ sister-wife in Min, but she seems to accept the idea at least. She has been having trouble learning Traveling again; the way Elayne forms the weave is different from how she used it to get to Seanchan, and it is difficult to learn something once you already learned it another way. She has, however, mastered the art of untying weaves—a feat which was thought impossible by all Aes Sedai, as well as the Forsaken. She and Elayne have adopted each other as first-sisters. Aviendha has a special ability in making wards against eavesdropping; it is unlikely even the Forsaken could breach one of her wards, and certainly no one could do so without her knowing it immediately. Aviendha was staying with Elayne at the Royal Palace in Caemlyn, but she was summoned away by the Wise Ones to complete her training. While in the Palace, she discovered a new Talent: the ability to sense the function of a _ter'angreal_ simply by holding it in her hands. Aviendha was very frustrated by the Wise Ones' treatment of her when she returned from her stay with Elayne; they seemed to be punishing her for no reason she could ascertain, and continually asked her opinion of matters as if to test her responses. It turned out that this was the last part of her training to become a Wise One: she must tell the Wise Ones she is one of them, or at least demand to be treated as an equal by them. They were pushing her harder and faster than they typically push apprentices because they had no time: she was needed at the Last Battle, and they had no time to wait for her to become ready on her own. She is currently at Rhuidean, going through the crystal columns that are the _ter'angreal_ of Aiel history. She expects she knows what she will find there, and is not looking forward to watching what she perceives to be the failure of her people. She is due to arrive at Rand's encampment with [Rhuarc](#Rhuarc) and much of the rest of her clan soon."

Another vibrates in the presence of men who can channel; it is likely this ornament that has allowed her to capture so many men to be gentled.

This hole, called the Bore, allowed the Dark One to once again touch the world, causing new outbreaks of war, treachery, violence, and crime. The attempt to free the Dark One completely resulted in the War of the Shadow (called the War of Power by some, especially those on the Shadow's side), during which a number of important leaders forsook the Light and gave their lives to the Dark One; these people are known today as the Forsaken, and were 13 of the most powerful Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends. The War of the Shadow did not end until [Lews Therin Telamon](#Lews-Therin-Telamon), the [Dragon](#The-Dragon), and his Hundred Companions Traveled to Shayol Ghul and re-sealed the Dark One back into his prison, trapping the Forsaken with him. At the moment of sealing, Shai'tan lashed out at those sealing the prison, driving them insane and tainting _saidin_ itself, the male half of the True Source, dooming all male Aes Sedai to madness as well and starting the Time of Madness. These seals are weakening now, enough that the Forsaken have escaped and the Dark One is once again able to exert influence on the world. These seals were scattered throughout the world by Aes Sedai during the Breaking of the World. In order of when they were discovered, they were found: 1) At the Eye of the World (broken when it was found); 2) in the hands of [Bayle Domon](#Bayle-Domon), later pilfered by High Lord Turak of the Seanchan (broken at the battle of Falme), 3) On Seanchan, part of High Lord Turak's collection (broken at the battle at Falme); 4) In the Great Hold at the Stone of Tear (still intact); 5) In the Panarch's Palace in Tanchico (broken enroute to Salidar); 6) One in Rhuidean (still intact), and 7) Found by [Mazrim Taim](#Mazrim-Taim) on a small farm in Saldaea (still intact). Despite being made of _cuendillar_, the three that remain unbroken can be cut with a knife and would break by a fall from a table.

    "info": "Young woman from Emond's Field and daughter of the innkeeper there, now raised to the [Amyrlin Seat](#The-Amyrlin-Seat). She has considerable strength with the One Power, and will most likely be one of the strongest Aes Sedai in over a thousand years. She is also the first Dreamer in the Tower in almost 500 years; she trained with the Wise Ones to learn more of this Talent. Before her time with the Wise Ones, she was sold by Liandrin to [Suroth](#Suroth-Sabelle-Meldarath) to be made _damane_. She was held captive under the name Tuli under care of the _sul'dam_ Renna Emain. When Egwene escaped, she left Renna with her _a'dam_ around Renna's neck; the fact that Renna and another _sul'dam_, [Seta](#Seta-Zarbey), who was similarly captured when Egwene escaped, were bound by the _a'dam_ threatens to destroy the foundation of Seanchan society, especially their enslavement of women who can channel. Egwene is good friends with [Elayne Trakand](#Queen-Elayne-Trakand), the Daughter-Heir of Andor, and is also a childhood friend of [Rand al'Thor](#Rand-al-Thor), the [Dragon Reborn](#Dragon-Reborn). In fact, Rand and Egwene were all but Promised in their youth, but both of them feel an almost sibling-like love for each other now; they know that they cannot get married, and do not want to. Egwene is the love object of both of Elayne's brothers, [Galad](#Lord-Captain-Commander-Galadedrid-Galad-Damodred) and [Gawyn](#Gawyn-Trakand)—she is flattered by Galad's attentions, but she does not return them. She does find Gawyn to her liking, and had a dream of bonding him as her Warder; she knows it will occur, though she and Gawyn have some things to work out between the two of them. Egwene was most likely chosen Amyrlin because she was in the Aiel Waste when the rebellion occurred, and because the Aes Sedai thought she could be manipulated by them without too much trouble; if this was their intent, they made a grave mistake, for Egwene promises to be one of the strongest Amyrlins in history. Egwene enlisted Gareth Bryne as the commander of her army to invade Tar Valon and remove [Elaida](#Elaida-do-Avriny-a-Roihan) from power. The invasion turned out to be unnecessary—Elaida was captured, and the Hall chose her to replace her before the invasion began. Egwene has opened the novice books to all interested women for the first time in history—in the past, they were only open to girls of a certain age, for fear that older women would not be able to handle the discipline. This policy has increased the Tower's population to levels unseen since [Artur Hawkwing](#High-King-Artur-Hawkwing)'s time. Egwene has also discovered many lost Talents of the Age of Legends, such as Dreaming, Traveling, and the making of _cuendillar_. She was guided to Dreaming by the Wise Ones, with whom she studied in the Aiel Waste, and was guided to the making of _cuendillar_ by [Moghedien](#Moghedien) while she was captured, but Traveling was her discovery alone—she worked it out herself based on her familiarity with Tel'aran'rhiod. She has recovered some other abilities through Moghedien as well. Prior to the reunification of the Tower, Egwene was captured by sisters loyal to Elaida after executing her plan to block the harbor by turning the harbor chain to _cuendillar_. She was held prisoner in the Tower, and re-enlisted as a Novice again. She accepted all punishments Elaida and others imposed upon her for insisting that she was still the Amyrlin Seat and still Aes Sedai. Her strong will and persistence earned her the respect of nearly all the novices, several of the Accepted, and more than a few Aes Sedai as well. Egwene's plans to subvert Elaida from the inside by making suggestions and hinting that various things Elaida has done are indefinsible helped convince even more sisters, including [Silviana](#Silviana-Brehon), to support her. Egwene tried very hard to convince the Hall—both the Hall in Tar Valon and the Hall in Exile—that they must be prepared for the Seanchan attack she knew was imminent. When it came anyway, she fought harder than perhaps anyone believed possible, doing almost as much damage to the Seanchan as they did to the Tower's inhabitants. Egwene was rescued from the Tower shortly after the raid by Gawyn, Bryne, and [Siuan](#Siuan-Sanche)—she was quite angry at Siuan and Gawyn for disobeying her orders to leave her be. Gawyn is still trying to crawl back into her good graces. She would probably refuse to acknowledge it, but she is almost as stubborn as [Nynaeve](#el-Nynaeve-ti-al-Meara-Mandragoran)."

    "info": "Aes Sedai formerly of the Red Ajah, now raised to the [Amyrlin Seat](#The-Amyrlin-Seat) in Tar Valon. She was born the youngest daughter of a minor House in the north of Murandy. She occasionally has the Foretelling, and as a result of a Foretelling she had concerning the importance of the Royal Family of Andor in Tarmon Gaidon, she served as advisor to [Queen Morgase](#Morgase-Trakand) of Andor for her entire reign. She later led the coup that deposed [Siuan Sanche](#Siuan-Sanche) and placed herself on the Amyrlin Seat in Siuan's place. She distrusts anyone not of the Red Ajah (as most Reds do), and does not think she will ever be able to trust any member of the Blue Ajah again. Her [Keeper of the Chronicles](#Keeper-of-the-Chronicles) was [Alviarin Freidhen](#Alviarin-Freidhen) of the White Ajah—she was all but forced to choose Alviarin due to her role in the deposition of Siuan. If she chose a Keeper from her Ajah, she most likely would not have won the support of the White Ajah, and then _she_ would have been stilled and exiled from the Tower instead of Siuan. She eventually removed Alviarin and raised [Tarna Feir](#Tarna-Feir) in her place after Alviarin vanished for some months. Her Foretelling about the importance of Andor's royal family during the Last Battle occurred around the time the Succession was going on, so she immediately attached herself to Morgase as soon as it became clear that she would be the one to take the Lion Throne. Another of her Foretellings was to predict that [Rand al'Thor](#Rand-al-Thor) would shake the world on its very foundations—she constantly kicks herself for not doing something about him when he was right in front of her, little more than a farmboy at the time. Her most recent Foretelling was that “the White Tower would be whole again, except for remnants cast out and scorned, whole and stronger than ever. [Rand al'Thor](#Rand-al-Thor) will face the Amyrlin Seat and know her anger. The Black Tower will be rent in blood and fire, and sisters will walk its grounds.” The Foretelling about Rand is obviously deadly accurate. However, the one about the Royal Family occurred at an inopportune time; at the time of Elaida's Foretelling, the Royal Family was not certain. It may have meant Morgase, [Gawyn](#Gawyn-Trakand), [Galad](#Lord-Captain-Commander-Galadedrid-Galad-Damodred), and [Elayne](#Queen-Elayne-Trakand) (they have all had a large role to play in the recent past), but it is also possible it could have meant the old Royal Family, that of [Tigraine](#Lady-Tigraine-Mantear), [Taringail](#Lord-Taringail-Damodred), Galad, and later Elayne and Gawyn as well. After all, Morgase is just Morgase, but Tigraine is the mother of the [Dragon Reborn](#Dragon-Reborn). Her most recent Foretelling will of course be fulfilled, but not necessarily how she wants it to be; she does not realize that the Amyrlin Seat in the Foretelling might not be her, that the remnants cast out might be those loyal to her, and that the destruction of the Black Tower might have nothing to do with her. Elaida is quite strong in the One Power; only Siuan (before she was stilled and Healed), [Moiraine](#Moiraine-Damodred), [Egwene](#Egwene-al-Vere), [Elayne](#Queen-Elayne-Trakand), [Nynaeve](#el-Nynaeve-ti-al-Meara-Mandragoran), and a few others could match her strength. Elaida has always sought positions of power; she chose to follow Morgase to have a better chance at guiding the forces in the Last Battle, and tried to capture Rand al'Thor in an effort to gain similar control. The only sisters that support her are those that are actually Black Ajah and those that would follow any Amyrlin legally raised, as Elaida was (although just barely; all laws used to raise her were stretched almost to their breaking point, and some believe they actually _did_ shatter). Elaida started to build a palace for herself atop the Warders' old practice yard. The building was to be about as tall as the White Tower. She had no plans to be merciful to those who rebelled against her when she deposed Siuan—her terms were that the Blue Ajah no longer existed, and that any sister who followed Egwene must serve penance under her personal guidance before being readmitted to the Tower. Elaida replaced Alviarin as Keeper with a sister of the Red Ajah, [Tarna Feir](#Tarna-Feir), and she has suspicions that Alviarin was trying to commit treason against the Tower. She ordered [Seaine Herimon](#Seaine-Herimon) to “follow the trail of treason” as far as it went, even to the Keeper herself. Seaine interpreted this as a charge to capture members of the Black Ajah, leading to a grave situation for Seaine, as she now has several Black sisters that she has uncovered and no longer feels she can trust Elaida. Elaida continually ignored Egwene's warnings about a Seanchan attack; when the attack came, Elaida was woefully unprepared, and a significant fraction of the Tower was captured and made _damane_, including herself. She is currently held captive as a _damane_ named [Suffa](#Suffa). She knows the weave for Traveling, and it is very unlikely she will be able to hold back that knowledge from the Seanchan."

Min does not always know what these viewings mean, but when she does, the viewings _will_ happen; it is only a question of how and when. Min was fascinated by the number of images she saw around [Rand](#Rand-al-Thor), especially the one she saw that included herself: he was destined to fall in love with three different women, one of which was herself. She usually dressed in attire reserved for men; this habit was picked up when growing up with her father, who was a miner. However, once she started to develop feelings for Rand, she began to wear more traditionally feminine attire—still coat and trousers, but cut to emphasize female characteristics. Min was in Tar Valon helping [Siuan](#Siuan-Sanche) with her viewings' information when Siuan was deposed, and it was Min that freed Siuan and [Leane](#Leane-Sharif) from the dungeon. She accompanied the two former leaders of the Aes Sedai to Salidar; once there, she left for Caemlyn with Salidar's embassy to Rand. Once in Caemlyn, she brought information to Rand about the embassy there, and its intentions. She has only had one viewing that ever failed, which concerned [Moiraine](#Moiraine-Damodred); since Moiraine is believed dead, she hopes that her viewings might be wrong at least once in a while.

She is the daughter of [Davram](#Lord-Davram-t-Ghaline-Bashere) and [Deira](#Deira-ni-Ghaline-t-Bashere) Bashere, their oldest surviving offspring. Her two older brothers were killed, and when Davram sent her younger brother off to fight while keeping her at home, she ran away and swore the oath of a Hunter of the Horn in Illian. When she became a Hunter, she renounced her old name, Zarine, at first considering adopting the name “Mandarb”—she chose Faile when she found that [Mandarb](#Mandarb) was the name of [Lan](#al-Lan-Mandragoran)'s horse. She fell in love with [Perrin Aybara](#Perrin-t-Bashere-Aybara) while on her search for the Horn, who told her that the Horn had been found. She was shocked, but even more so to find out that [Rand](#Rand-al-Thor) was the [Dragon Reborn](#Dragon-Reborn) and that both he and Perrin are _ta'veren_. Faile stayed near Perrin, and finally accompanied him to the Two Rivers where she helped fend off the Trolloc attacks; the two were married shortly afterwards. They were then proclaimed Lord and Lady of the Two Rivers. Perrin hated the idea, but Faile insisted they have a modest estate, and even servants, which she trained herself. Her name means “falcon” in the Old Tongue; she is the falcon in [Min](#Elmindreda-Min-Farshaw)'s viewings of Perrin. She is very protective of her blacksmith, and does whatever she can to make sure he not so much as _looks_ at another woman, even though he has no intention of doing so. She is a very jealous wife, especially toward people like [Berelain](#Berelain-sur-Paendrag-Paeron) who eye her husband all the time. She even cornered [Min](#Elmindreda-Min-Farshaw) when they first came to Caemlyn and Perrin greeted her warmly, to make sure Min had no intentions toward him. She left with Perrin for Ghealdan to find [Masema](#Masema-Dagar), and while he was away her party was ambushed by the Shaido Aiel and she was taken _gai'shain_ by them. She and the servants captured with her attempted to escape, but were betrayed by Galina Casban. She was now a personal servant of [Sevanna](#Sevanna), and she seemed to be one of Sevanna's favorites—for both service and punishment. She is a natural leader, even earning the respect and obedience of [Alliandre](#Queen-Alliandre-Maritha-Kigarin), the Queen of Ghealdan, and [Morgase](#Morgase-Trakand), the former Queen of Andor (though she does not know Morgase's true identity). Alliandre, Morgase, and Faile were rescued by the _Mera'din_, the Brotherless, Aiel men traveling with the Shaido when the left the Three-Fold Land. Their rescue coincided with Perrin's attack on the Shaido encampment, resulting in the deaths of many of the Aielmen. Now that she has been rescued, Faile has taken it upon herself to do the things her husband is unable or unwilling to do—first among them, killing [Masema](#Masema-Dagar), the [Prophet](#The-Prophet-of-the-Dragon). She has since been trying to patch things up with Berelain, attempting to deal with the rumors about inappropriate relations between her and Perrin."

He and his half-brother [Galad](#Lord-Captain-Commander-Galadedrid-Galad-Damodred) went to train with the Warders in the White Tower, as all sons of Andoran queens have for centuries, and both now possess considerable skill with the sword. During the chaos that erupted after [Siuan Sanche](#Siuan-Sanche)'s deposition, Gawyn formed a band of young men, everyone who had trained with the Warders except Galad, who are called the Younglings. The Younglings fought back against their teachers, who were trying to free Siuan and [Leane](#Leane-Sharif) from their imprisonment. Gawyn himself killed [Hammar](#Hammar) and Coulin, the men in charge of teaching the sword and for his personal training, respectively, both of which were Blademasters—few Warders are as good as they were, and Gawyn managed to kill both of them. When he learned more of what actually happened, Gawyn did not know which party to support—he believed that anyone who opposed Tower Law by trying to free Siuan and Leane was wrong, but at the same time he realized he did not know all the facts surrounding the change in leadership. In fact, his sister Elayne and her friends [Nynaeve al'Meara](#el-Nynaeve-ti-al-Meara-Mandragoran) and [Egwene al'Vere](#Egwene-al-Vere) side with those who broke from the Tower, and Egwene, the woman he wants to marry, is their new leader. He believes the rumor that [Rand](#Rand-al-Thor) killed his mother, and only refrains from killing him because Egwene made him promise not to. Gawyn has made many enemies inside and outside the Tower, just by leading the Younglings. He detests Rand because he thinks Rand killed his mother, and there is no telling how he will react when he finds out that Elayne actually does love Rand. Gawyn led the Younglings on harrying parties against the army besieging Tar Valon; Lord Bryne was quite upset to find out that it was someone who had inside information about his tactics that was harrying him so successfully. At one time, Gawyn had no problem with the fact that he had killed his former teachers—they were rebelling against a lawfully raised Amyrlin—but he has since begun to feel guilty, wondering if he had truly chosen the just side. He has stated that he did not like Elaida—she had always been cold to him as his mother's advisor—but he supported her because he disliked what Siuan had done, involving Egwene and Elayne in her plotting. Eventually, he learned that Egwene herself lead the rebels, and that she had been captured. He stubbornly refused to believe she could _possibly_ be safe as a prisoner, and vowed to do anything to rescue her. He eventually jumped at the chance to help Siuan mount a rescue; Egwene is quite angry at him (and at Siuan) for disobeying her direct orders. Gawyn is trying to discover what his relationship to Egwene needs to be as her Warder, which of course he must do before she bonds him. He is finding that situation very trying—he is used to being his own person. His sign is a white boar."

She and another Aes Sedai named Beidomon bored into the prison, creating what is now referred to as simply the Bore, allowing the Dark One to touch the world again and leading to the War of the Shadow. Around this time, Mierin formed a relationship with [Lews Therin Telamon](#Lews-Therin-Telamon), who headed the forces of the Light against the Shadow and was the most powerful man she had found. Lews Therin broke off the relationship when he found that she only wanted him for his power and authority and the possibility of power for herself through him.

Eventually, she went to Shayol Ghul to dedicate her soul to the Shadow, most likely to finally get back at Lews Therin for leaving her. She declared as her territory the World of Dreams, _Tel'aran'rhiod_, using it to ends now unknown. She transferred her obsessive love intact to Lews Therin's soul's new body, [Rand al'Thor](#Rand-al-Thor), after being freed from the Bore.

She became an Aes Sedai, a member of the Blue Ajah, and was eventually raised to [Keeper of the Chronicles](#Keeper-of-the-Chronicles) under [Siuan Sanche](#Siuan-Sanche). During the coup led by [Elaida a'Roihan](#Elaida-do-Avriny-a-Roihan) and [Alviarin Freidhen](#Alviarin-Freidhen) that deposed Siuan, Leane was thrown in the dungeon and stilled. Leane tried turning to her seductive side to try to replace what she lost in stilling; she was out of practice, but did well enough. She eventually convinced the Aes Sedai in Salidar to let her stay with them and maintain the network of eyes-and-ears she kept in Tar Valon as Keeper. She was later Healed by [Nynaeve](#el-Nynaeve-ti-al-Meara-Mandragoran), and restored to some of her former capacity for using the One Power. The Hall of the Tower in Salidar decided that since she had been stilled, she was no longer Aes Sedai for that time and thus all of her titles and choice of Ajah were null and void. Instead of petitioning to re-enter the Blue Ajah, she asked the Green Ajah if it would accept her; it did, and she became the first sister to ever switch Ajahs. Her eyes-and-ears as Keeper are retained by her; she was the only Aes Sedai to plant spies in the city itself. These spies were very useful in determining both what is going on in Tar Valon and what the Ajahs were leaving out of their reports to [Egwene](#Egwene-al-Vere). She has considerable strength with Earth, and is the second best at making _cuendillar_, after Egwene herself. While carrying out Egwene's plan to turn the harbor chains to _cuendillar_, she was captured and held in the dungeons below the Tower. She was allowed only one dress, the one in which she was captured, which she washed every third day in the remains of her bath water. Now that the Tower has been reunited, Leane is held in some esteem among the novices and Accepted—not only was she stilled yet still channels, she changed Ajahs!"

During the War of the Shadow, at the age of 400, he led the forces of the Light against the Forsaken, and led the final stroke which re-sealed the [Dark One](#Dark-One) back into his prison. Unfortunately, during this stroke he was driven insane by the Dark One's touch, eventually killing his wife Ilyena, his children, and everyone he loved, as well as anyone who carried a drop of his blood. For this act, people remember him with a new name: Kinslayer. After he had done this, [Ishamael](#Ishamael) gave him his sanity back long enough for him to realize what he had done; Lews Therin killed himself by drawing on _saidin_ too heavily, causing a mountain to form on the spot where he stood. This mountain is called Dragonmount, and is near the present-day city of Tar Valon. It is unfortunate that the name of one of the greatest men to ever live is now synonymous with evil, for Lews Therin killed his family due to the Dark One's influence, but without Lews Therin there may not have been a world left in which to kill them. Lews Therin's voice often spoke inside [Rand](#Rand-al-Thor)'s head, offering advice or sobbing over lost women or ranting about killing men who could channel. It even tried to seize control of _saidin_ sometimes, much to Rand's fear—Rand was certain that Lews Therin could not take control of _saidin_ away from him if he seized it first, but experience had shown that if Lews Therin seized it first, Rand would be at his mercy until he released. [Semirhage](#Semirhage) revealed that Lews Therin's voice in Rand's head is not without precedent—indeed, hearing a real voice often indicates a person dangerously close to outright insanity. Rand's time spent atop Dragonmount, when he destroyed the remaining Choedan Kal, seems to have liberated Rand's brain from the Dark One's touch—he no longer hears the voice in his head, and has effectively reunited Lews Therin's memories with his own inside Rand's head."

Galad believed that Valda killed his mother after sexually abusing her, and killed him as punishment for this. He was incorrect about the killing part, at least. Galad has much skill with the sword, and has officially achieved Blademaster status by killing Valda, by many accounts one of the greatest swordsmen in the world. According to [Rand](#Rand-al-Thor)'s visions of [Perrin](#Perrin-t-Bashere-Aybara), Galad currently travels with Perrin. He leads the 7000 or so men that remain part of the Children under the Lord Captain Commander; the rest separated to follow [Rhadam Asunawa](#Rhadam-Asunawa), the High Inquisitor."

    "info": "A young man from Emond's Field. He is _ta'veren_. Along with his good friends, [Rand al'Thor](#Rand-al-Thor) and [Perrin Aybara](#Perrin-t-Bashere-Aybara), he left home to escape the Trolloc attacks after Winternight. On the way to Tar Valon, he picked up a dagger from Shadar Logoth tainted with the evil that destroyed Aridhol, which he carried with him for a long time. He was separated from the dagger by Aes Sedai Healing, but doing so caused large gaps in his memory sequence. These gaps were filled and more when he passed through the twisted door to the land of the Eelfinn, where he was granted his three requests: a foxhead medallion that protects him from women's channeling, a way out of the land of the Eelfinn, and the memories of past lifetimes that were the gaps in his memory. Mat's _ta'veren_ qualities manifest themselves particularly well with random events, such as dice games—he almost never loses a toss of the dice, even if the dice are weighted. He has found that battles are the ultimate form of gambling, and along with his newfound memories, he can win almost every battle he fights quite decisively. He has four sisters, including Eldrin and Bodewhin, who were 16 and 17, respectively, when Mat left Emond's Field. His father Abell is one of the best archers in the Two Rivers, probably in the World. Mat has gotten in the habit of carrying concealed knives under his clothes in case he is attacked—his collection would surprise anyone. In the Waste, he met a woman named Melindhra, a Maiden of the Spear from the Shaido Clan. However, she was not the [Daughter of the Nine Moons](#Daughter-of-the-Nine-Moons), who Mat was destined to marry according to the Aelfinn; besides, she tried to kill him on orders from her master among the Darkfriends. Mat had to kill her to save his own skin, but regretted it deeply. He also has a scar along his neck from where the Eelfinn tried to hang him—which was also in accordance with what the Aelfinn told him, that he is “to die and live again.” He created an army called the Band of the Red Hand, after the army of King Aemon of old Manetheren, and served in a way as Rand's personal general—this worked well, since Mat seems to be a better general than even [Davram Bashere](#Lord-Davram-t-Ghaline-Bashere), who has earned his reputation as one of the best commanders alive. Mat does not trust any Aes Sedai, and because of this refuses to take his foxhead medallion off even to take a bath. Mat went to Ebou Dar to try to keep an eye on [Elayne](#Queen-Elayne-Trakand) and [Nynaeve](#el-Nynaeve-ti-al-Meara-Mandragoran) and prevent them from getting themselves killed. While there, he was cornered by [Queen Tylin](#Queen-Tylin-Quintara-Mitsobar), who gave him little choice but to become her lover. When the Sea Folk and the Seanchan did battle in the city, he made his escape, leaving Tylin tied up under the bed so it looked “official”—Tylin was found torn limb from limb, obviously by the _gholam_, which was no doubt sent to kill Mat. In the process of leaving, Mat also took several _sul'dam_ and _damane_ (who were subsequently freed from their collars), and even kidnapped [Tuon](#High-Lady-Tuon-Athaem-Kore-Paendrag), the [Daughter of the Nine Moons](#Daughter-of-the-Nine-Moons) herself. Mat traveled with [Valan Luca](#Valan-Luca)'s show to keep out of Seanchan sight for quite some time. Tuon has now completed Mat's unwitting marriage ceremony; he is now among the highest of the Seanchan ruling class, the [First Prince of the Ravens](#Prince-of-the-Ravens), despite his insistence that he will fight the Seanchan during any battle if such battle is necessary. Mat is as yet unaware that Tuon is (metaphorically) dead, and that his wife is now the [Empress](#The-Empress-of-Seanchan-) of Seanchan, [Fortuona](#Empress-Fortuona-Athaem-Devi-Paendrag). Mat still has one major task ahead of him: answering [Moiraine](#Moiraine-Damodred)'s letter to [Thom](#Thomdril-Thom-Merrilin), which asks him to help rescue her from the Eelfinn. Mat is currently in Caemlyn, asking [Elayne](#Queen-Elayne-Trakand) for help producing [Aludra](#Aludra)'s dragons, what most of us would call cannons."

She is considered short among her people, and the Cairhienin are already a short people. When it was discovered that she had the ability to channel inborn, Moiraine went to Tar Valon to become an Aes Sedai.

In the Stone of Tear, Moiraine confronted and killed the Forsaken Be'lal with balefire, just before he would have killed Rand. Later, after having an inkling of the future events from the testing _ter'angreal_ for the Wise Ones, Moiraine managed to push the Forsaken [Lanfear](#Lanfear) through the twisted doorway _ter'angreal_ into the land of the Eelfinn, trapping both her and Lanfear there.

The same letter convinced [Mat](#Matrim-Mat-Cauthon) to help Thom rescue her, though her vision in the _ter'angreal_ apparently indicated disaster would result unless Mat _asked_ to see the letter before Thom showed it to him. Other Aes Sedai consider Moiraine a legend, not only for discovering the [Dragon Reborn](#Dragon-Reborn) but for killing or trapping two of the Forsaken as well. Despite her efforts, and for the most part, success, [Cadsuane](#Cadsuane-Melaidhrin) still thinks she “bungled” things with Rand. Moiraine's current state of health is unknown."

Taringail was Elayne's and Gawyn's father; he died when they were young. Morgase has since gone through several lovers, including [Thomdril Merrilin](#Thomdril-Thom-Merrilin), a former court-bard; Gareth Bryne, her First Prince of the Sword and Captain of the Guards; and most recently [Lord Gaebril](#Lord-Gaebril), a man who led the faction that stilled the riots in Caemlyn that sprang up on Morgase's trip to Tar Valon to inquire about Elayne's whereabouts. Thom was exiled from the city of Caemlyn when he started telling her what he really thought of some of her plans, her relationship with Bryne ebbed away until finally Gaebril told her to exile him too, and Gaebril eventually chased Morgase herself out of the city when she found he was usurping her power. The Daughter-Heir of Andor is traditionally trained by Aes Sedai in the White Tower, and Morgase underwent novice training to keep the tradition alive. She was given the gift of a Great Serpent ring despite not being Accepted, and still wears it on her left hand. She was previously advised by [Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan](#Elaida-do-Avriny-a-Roihan) of the Red Ajah, who is now the [Amyrlin Seat](#The-Amyrlin-Seat) in Tar Valon. When Morgase discovered that Gaebril (who, unbeknownst to her, was actually [Rahvin](#Rahvin)) meant to usurp her throne, she left, and when she learned that the [Dragon Reborn](#Dragon-Reborn) had taken over Caemlyn and none of her former supporters would give her aid, she fled to Amadicia to get help from the only place she thought she could: [Pedron Niall](#Pedron-Niall) and the Children of the Light. She was not aware that [Rand](#Rand-al-Thor) only wanted to give her country back to her, not to mention believes that she is dead. If she had made her presence known, she would no doubt have had her country back in one piece, but as royalty she believed she must work on her own and trust no one. She went into hiding after the Seanchan attack ([Eamon Valda](#Lord-Captain-Commander-Eamon-Valda) believes her to be dead) under her mother's first name, Maighdin to avoid instant recognition, and later became a maidservant to [Faile](#Faile-ni-Bashere-t-Aybara); she told Faile that she was a lady's handmaid before coming into her service. When Faile's group was captured, she became a prisoner of the Shaido, and is now detained in their encampment. Her sign is three golden keys. Morgase has come to many realizations about her life, and about her choice in men: Taringail saw her as a pawn, Thom as a beauty to be hunted and romanced, Gareth Bryne as a queen to be served. None had made her his entire life. However, a former member of the Queen's Guard, [Martyn Tallanvor](#Guardsman-Lieutenant-Martyn-Tallanvor), has taken a liking to his former queen, and she finds herself almost unconsciously returning his attentions. Her adopted son [Galad](#Lord-Captain-Commander-Galadedrid-Galad-Damodred) believes her dead at the hands of Eamon Valda, and plans revenge on him.

Her daughter Elayne believes her dead as well (though she as yet has no plans for vengeance), and her new mistress Faile has no idea of her true identity. Since we know from Rand's visions of [Perrin](#Perrin-t-Bashere-Aybara) that Galad and Perrin eventually cross paths, it appears that a family reunion is in the works."

He has been declared [Nae'blis](#Nae-blis), the one to be second only to the Great Lord of the Dark after the Last Battle, and given control of the _cour'souvra_ controlling the minds of Cyndane and [Moghedien](#Moghedien). He has also been granted the exclusive privilege of using the True Power—the other Forsaken are no longer able to touch it even should they want to. Moridin helped Rand, in a way, during his fight with Sammael in Shadar Logoth. Their two streams of balefire crossed, causing both of their heads to ring, and ever since then there has been a link between Moridin and Rand that Moridin does not completely understand and Rand seems unaware exists. Its influence is clear, however—now that Rand's hand is missing, Moridin's left hand does not work as well as it should. Moridin has recently granted [Graendal](#Graendal) some limited access to the True Power, though he has her on a short leash. He is a grand master at the game of Sha'rah, a chess-like game from the Age of Legends; Moridin believes the game to be a distant memory of the battle with the Dark One during this Age in the previous turnings of the Wheel. His connection with Rand recently allowed Rand to enter his dreams; the same connection seems to have given Rand access to the True Power. He turned to the Shadow for reasons of logic: following the Light meant the struggle continued forever, with no path to victory. Following the Shadow meant ruling for a short time before everything was destroyed."

She claims this is because she hates watching Warders die once their Aes Sedai is dead. Nynaeve's last task before being raised “officially&rdrquo; was to demand that Myrelle pass Lan's bond to her.

Perrin is a childhood friend of fellow _ta'veren_ [Rand al'Thor](#Rand-al-Thor) and [Mat Cauthon](#Matrim-Mat-Cauthon). On the way to Tear, Perrin encountered a young woman by the name of [Zarine Bashere](#Lady-Zarine-ni-Bashere-t-Aybara), a Hunter for the Horn who took the name of [Faile](#Faile-ni-Bashere-t-Aybara) (which means “Falcon” in the Old Tongue) as a more appropriate name for a Hunter for the Horn. The two are now married. Perrin is a very large man—he was always a big person, which caused him to be very cautious since he found as a child that he could easily hurt other children if his temper got out of hand. His size helped considerably when helping [Master Luhhan](#Haral-Luhhan) on his forge, but that combined with his careful nature sometimes gave others the impression that he is slow and stupid. He returned to the Two Rivers for a time to repel the series of Trolloc attacks; he and his wife are recognized as Lord and Lady there, the first noblility of the Two Rivers since the Trolloc Wars. When he returned, he began to draw the eye of [Berelain sur Paendrag Paeron](#Berelain-sur-Paendrag-Paeron), the First of Mayene—Perrin wants nothing more than to be as far from her as possible, but Berelain will not take no for an answer, much to Faile's dismay and intense jealousy. Perrin was instrumental in freeing Rand from his entrapment at Dumai's Wells; the two had a fight afterwards (they had planned it as a way for Perrin to leave, although they most likely did not plan on it being as violent as it was), and Perrin went to Ghealdan to see if he could tame [Masema](#Masema-Dagar). On the way, his wife was captured by Shaido, and he spent weeks single-mindedly trying to track her down. He eventually formed an alliance with Tylee Khirgan, a Seanchan Banner-General, to help him defeat the Shaido and free his wife. Despite his strong desires to avoid both combat and lordship, Perrin has become a very good general and leader. He is currently mired in Ghealdan, and is having some issues keeping the man in him separate from the wolf."

She is the daughter of [Morgase](#Morgase-Trakand) and her late husband, [Taringail Damodred](#Lord-Taringail-Damodred), and sister to [Gawyn](#Gawyn-Trakand). She is also half-sister to [Galad](#Lord-Captain-Commander-Galadedrid-Galad-Damodred), although she would rather not be reminded of this fact; she thinks Galad virtuous to the point of fault, and does not really like him. She has considerable potential in the One Power, and is one of the strongest female channelers in a thousand years or more, possibly since the Age of Legends, with the exceptions of [Egwene](#Egwene-al-Vere), [Nynaeve](#el-Nynaeve-ti-al-Meara-Mandragoran), Sharina, [Aviendha](#Aviendha), and some trainees. She has red-gold curly hair. During her stay in the Stone of Tear, Elayne realized she loved [Rand al'Thor](#Rand-al-Thor), and told him how she felt; he felt similarly. She had no idea at the time what [Min](#Elmindreda-Min-Farshaw) meant about “having to share him,” but now knows about Min's viewing of Rand with the three women's heads, indicating that Rand will fall in love with Min, Elayne, and Aviendha, and they with him. Later, when she and Nynaeve had trouble with [Moghedien](#Moghedien), Elayne ended up bonding [Birgitte](#Birgitte) as her Warder (despite being only Accepted at the time) in order to save Birgitte's life. Elayne later went to Ebou Dar and found the Bowl of the Winds, a _ter'angreal_ that they used to fix the weather. She then returned to Andor upon hearing news of her mother's disappearance; she has since taken the Lion Throne, fighting the Black Ajah, Darkfriends, and other Andoran nobles. She recently ended [Arymilla](#Arymilla-Marne)'s campaign for the Throne, which convinced all but one of the necessary nobles to support her for the Lion Throne. During that campaign, Elayne was captured by the Black Ajah, though Birgitte convinced the Windfinders to help rescue her. She then convinced several other houses to support her—evidently their main concern was that she would be a puppet of Rand al'Thor. In the mean time, Elayne has managed to reproduce several _ter'angreal_, something which no one else has been able to do since the Breaking of the World, as well as discover a way to share a Warder bond between three women; she bonded Rand along with Aviendha, her new sister by Aiel tradition, and Min. Shortly after bonding Rand, she became pregnant with Rand's twins. To protect the children, she is not revealing the father of the twins, and has allowed the rumor that [Doilin Mellar](#Captain-Doilin-Mellar) is their father to persist as an added means of protection. She is the first ruler of Andor to _ever_ cede land to anyone: she agreed with the Sea Folk to cede a few square miles of Andor to them in exchange for their help feeding the city during the siege. She also sends Andoran troops to the Black Tower (which is on Andoran soil) periodically to remind its inhabitants that they are still within Andor and subject to its laws. She is proving to be a capable leader, one her people may eventually be quite proud of, though for now times in Andor are hard enough that most do not appreciate her yet."

    "info": "A young man from Emond's Field in the Two Rivers, now proclaimed to be the [Dragon Reborn](#Dragon-Reborn). He is very tall, with curly red-blond hair and bright blue-gray eyes that shine like gemstones. He was raised by [Tam al'Thor](#Tamlin-Tam-al-Thor) and his wife Kari (until her death around the time Rand was five) in Emond's Field. His real parents, however, were Janduin, the chief of the Taardad Aiel who brought the four clans across the Dragonwall to punish [Laman](#Laman-Damodred)'s Sin, and a Maiden of the Spear named Shaiel, who was actually [Tigraine Mantear](#Lady-Tigraine-Mantear), the runaway Daughter-Heir of Andor. Tigraine gave birth to Rand on the slopes of Dragonmount, in accordance with prophecy: “born of a Maiden, of the ancient blood but raised by the Old.” Rand has a heron branded into each of his palms, which he received from the sword Tam gave him while fighting [Ishamael](#Ishamael). He also has two dragons on his forearms, which he received in Rhuidean to designate him as the _[Car'a'carn](#Car-a-carn)_, the Chief of Chiefs of the Aiel. He has recently taken to wearing a new sword: curved, with a black scabbard, painted with two twisting dragons much like those on his forearms. It was found under a submerged statue. He is not only the Dragon Reborn, but also He Who Comes With the Dawn, the man prophesied to reunite the Aiel, and the [Coramoor](#Coramoor), the one prophesied to bring the Sea Folk out of the Sea. He can channel strongly, more so than any person who ever lived (except the previous user of his soul, [Lews Therin Telamon](#Lews-Therin-Telamon), who was obviously of equal strength), and is also _ta'veren_, the most strongly so since Lews Therin as well. Lews Therin's voice seemed to have found a new place inside of Rand's head for some time; he talked to him in a mad voice when Rand least expected it, sometimes offering sound advice or knowledge, sometimes babbling, sometimes even trying to wrest control of _saidin_ from him. [Semirhage](#Semirhage) revealed that hearing this voice was a symptom of the madness associated with touching tainted _saidin_ for as long as Rand did. Unlike Lews Therin, Rand is accompanied by two other _ta'veren_ during this turing of the Wheel, two men born within days (hours, even) of him named [Matrim Cauthon](#Matrim-Mat-Cauthon) and [Perrin Aybara](#Perrin-t-Bashere-Aybara), who both grew up in Emond's Field as well. Rand is destined to fall in love with three women (and has): [Min Farshaw](#Elmindreda-Min-Farshaw), [Elayne Trakand](#Queen-Elayne-Trakand), and [Aviendha](#Aviendha). Rand has had success in fighting many of the Forsaken; all to confront him have died or been trapped. He killed [Aginor](#Aginor) at the Eye of the World after the Green Man killed Balthamel; he allowed [Moiraine](#Moiraine-Damodred) to kill Be'lal in the Stone of Tear, and killed [Ishamael](#Ishamael) in the Stone shortly afterward; in the wagons near the Spine of the World, [Lanfear](#Lanfear) confronted him and was pushed into the land of the Eelfinn by Moiraine; he killed [Rahvin](#Rahvin) in _Tel'aran'rhiod_ when he came to the Royal Palace in Caemlyn; [Asmodean](#Asmodean), his teacher, was killed shortly after Rahvin met his fate; Sammael met his fate while fighting Rand in Shadar Logoth at the hands of Mashadar; Osan'gar, the reincarnation of [Aginor](#Aginor), died at Shador Logoth when Rand was cleansing _saidin_; [Semirhage](#Semirhage) was captured during her attempt to capture Rand and bind him with a male _a'dam_; and [Aran'gar](#Aran-gar) died when he attacked [Graendal](#Graendal)'s hold at [Natrin](#Natrin)'s Barrow. During his duel with Sammael, Rand encountered a mysterious wanderer, who turned out to be [Moridin](#Moridin), who helped him. During the fighting, their streams of balefire collided, causing Rand's head to spin and both of them to lose coherency for a while. Ever since that time, Rand has had trouble seizing _saidin_; it is not known if this is because of Moridin's use of the True Power or something else. During his fight with Semirhage, Rand had his hand burned away by her weave of Fire; Moridin has since been seen favoring his left hand, as if Rand's injury is somehow affecting him. Since the hand cannot be repaired, Rand has moved on without it—others have compared it to the reaction one might have after losing a glove. Rand was captured for a brief period by [Semirhage](#Semirhage), after [Shaidar Haran](#Shaidar-Haran) freed her from her captivity at Aes Sedai hands. She attempted to force him to choke Min to death, but Rand's connection to Moridin evidently allowed him to access the True Power, and he used that connection to weave balefire and destroy Semirhage. Thereafter, Rand steeled himself to do what he must, without emotional influence, without distraction from feelings, until finally the emotions grew too much to handle—he finally Traveled to Dragonmount, standing upon his own grave in fulfillment of Prophecy, and contemplated his life, and all of his past lives, finally determining that life and creation were not worth it unless you could laugh and cry. He destroyed the male Choedan Kal, and seems to have cured his madness (or at least blocked it somehow) in the process. Rand's prophecies fulfilled grow: he has already been born on the slopes of Dragonmount of a Maiden, of the ancient blood but raised by the old, taken the Stone of Tear and drawn _Callandor_, and began conquering “under the forgotten symbol,” that of the Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends. He is working on having the “spotless tower” (i.e., the White Tower) break and bend knee to him (the Tower has broken, and several Aes Sedai have sworn fealty to him and only him). He slayed “his people” (the Aiel) with the “sword of peace” and destroyed them “with the [Way of the] Leaf” (referring to his dividing the Aiel with news that they used to be a peacful, non-violent people). He has “wounds of madness” from Fain's dagger (and from the taint), and has led the Aiel spears “from the city, lost and forsaken” (Rhuidean). And of course, he has stood “on his own grave” and wept, referring to his scene at Dragonmount where he went from being “blind” to the reasons for life to “seeing” the reasons of life again. Some time ago, he used the Choedan Kal, the two great _sa'angreal_ created during the War of the Shadow, to cleanse the [Dark One](#Dark-One)'s taint from _saidin_. He has created schools of sorts, more research universities, where some of the best inventors of the day have congregated near Cairhien, Caemlyn, and Tear to develop new technology. Rand has also created the Asha'man, men who came for his “amnesty” for male channelers. With _saidin_ cleansed, the Asha'man are now safe from the [Dark One](#Dark-One)'s taint. The Asha'man themselves are not free from the Dark One's _influence_, however; there are many Darkfriends among the Asha'man, including [Mazrim Taim](#Mazrim-Taim), the leader of the Black Tower. The Asha'man under Taim have turned on Rand, trying to kill him and worse, though Rand does not at this point know that they were acting with Taim's knowledge. Rand is under _considerable_ stress at the moment—he has made it a point to make himself harder, believing that emotionlessness is the key to surviving to do what he must do. Rand is the salvation of the entire world, and as the prophecy states, he _will_ save the world—and Break it again."

She was born the daughter of an innkeeper, and was first trained by the Daughters of Silence (an organization similar to, but shorter-lived and smaller than, the Kin)—she was the only one of them to ever obtain the shawl. She is good at taking charge of things, and immediately took charge of the organization to fetter out Darkfriends in the Tower with [Pevara](#Pevara-Tazanovni), dismissing [Seaine](#Seaine-Herimon) from her position. She has olive skin. She is one of the few Browns who are intimidating. Saerin was [Egwene](#Egwene-al-Vere)'s second choice for Keeper once she re-entered the Tower as [Amyrlin](#The-Amyrlin-Seat), though she suspected choosing her would weaken herself; people would see Saerin as the true power behind the Seat.

When the Hall was arguing over who to raise as [Amyrlin](#The-Amyrlin-Seat) years back, it was deadlocked over four candidates who had each worn the shawl about fifty years; the Hall wanted an Amyrlin that was younger than the eighty or more years than were common. Seaine suggested [Siuan Sanche](#Siuan-Sanche), then a young Blue sister that had worn the shawl for only ten years; she was eventually raised. Later, Seaine was charged by [Elaida](#Elaida-do-Avriny-a-Roihan) to find Darkfriends in the Tower; Elaida hopes to expose [Alviarin](#Alviarin-Freidhen) on the suspicion that she is Black Ajah.

Seaine eventually found that she was set to her task because of a misunderstanding: Elaida asked her how she was getting along “with discovering proof that Alviarin entered a treasonous correspondence with the [Dragon Reborn](#Dragon-Reborn). Elaida's exact words were, “We can never be sure who has the shadow of treason in her heart, Seaine. Why, I suspect that someone arranged for an order of mine to be countermanded. And I have reason to believe that someone has communicated privately with [Rand al'Thor](#Rand-al-Thor); to what end, I cannot say, but that surely is treason against me, and against the Tower.

What you find, whoever it leads to, you will bring before the [Amyrlin Seat](#The-Amyrlin-Seat) alone, Seaine. No one else must know.” Seaine interpreted this to mean Darkfriends in the Tower, and therefore assumed Elaida could not be a Darkfriend. She and her associates were no longer so sure after realizing what she had actually said, so they stepped carefully. [Ferane](#Ferane-Neheran) wanted Seaine raised Amyrlin when Elaida was captured.

However, she was sadistic; she exacted a price in the form of pain from her subjects in return for her Healing services. Most thought the pain or anguish she exacted from them was a small price to pay for being alive, but eventually the Hall of Servants found out about her practices and gave her the choice of being either severed or bound with the Power, never again to know her “pleasures.” She chose instead to pledge for the [Dark One](#Dark-One), and created one of the most oppressive and pain-filled areas of Shadow control during the entire War of Power. She became an expert at sadism and torture; she considers her greatest achievement to be a weave which removes the victim's blood and replaces it, instantaneously, with another liquid that causes every nerve in the body to fire with pain simultaneously—the victims typically survived about an hour. After being freed from the Bore, Semirhage went in service to the Dark One by extracting information from captured Borderlanders and Aes Sedai. She also sent the Trollocs to the Stone of Tear to battle those that Sammael sent. She was as tall as most men, and wore black most of the time—perhaps because [Lanfear](#Lanfear) always wore white. It is often joked (or used to be, when the Forsaken were still bound) that when it rained during the daylight that the Dark One was beating her.

She had an uneasy alliance with [Mesaana](#Mesaana) and [Demandred](#Demandred) before she was captured by [Rand](#Rand-al-Thor) after her unsuccessful attempt to capture him.

Egwene was impressed enough with Silviana's behavior—both in doing her duty as she saw it by beating Egwene, no matter how much she resented doing it, and in being brave enough to stand up to Elaida when no one else would—that she appointed her to be [Keeper of the Chronicles](#Keeper-of-the-Chronicles) in the reunited Tower. She has transfered her dedication and competence to the new post with alacrity. She has a deep dislike for [Gawyn](#Gawyn-Trakand), though why is not fully evident."

    "info": "Aes Sedai of the Blue Ajah with shoulder-length hair. Born in Tear to a fisherman, she was sent to the White Tower on the first boat to leave after she discovered she had the ability to channel inborn, according to Tairen law. As a novice, she was good friends with [Moiraine Damodred](#Moiraine-Damodred), and was present at Gitara Moroso's Foretelling of the Rebirth of the [Dragon](#The-Dragon). After being raised to the shawl, she joined the Blue Ajah to dedicate her life to finding and guiding the [Dragon Reborn](#Dragon-Reborn), and eventually came to lead the Blues' network of eyes-and-ears (i.e., spies) before being raised to the [Amyrlin Seat](#The-Amyrlin-Seat). She was only thirty years old when raised to the Amyrlin Seat, making her the youngest Amyrlin to that point. She was also one of the strongest Amyrlins in recent history, and one of the most feared among the rulers of nations. Her blue-eyed stare was feared by all. When her twenty-year connection to the [Dragon Reborn](#Dragon-Reborn) was discovered, she and her [Keeper of the Chronicles](#Keeper-of-the-Chronicles), [Leane Sharif](#Leane-Sharif), were deposed and stilled by a group of sisters loyal to [Elaida a'Roihan](#Elaida-do-Avriny-a-Roihan). Siuan and Leane escaped with [Min](#Elmindreda-Min-Farshaw)'s help and found the rebel Aes Sedai in Salidar. Siuan hoped to regain some of her previous standing in the new Tower that separated from Elaida—her knowledge of the Blue Ajah spy network is hard to match, and she knows much that she thought would be of use. In one of her viewings, [Min](#Elmindreda-Min-Farshaw) saw that Siuan would have to remain close to Gareth Bryne—if she did not, both of them would die. Siuan did not initially know what she meant, but now realizes that she is growing to love the gray-haired man who leads the rebel army. She later realized that the viewing was related to the attack on the Tower by the Seanchan. Siuan had a Warder named Alric, but he was murdered by Elaida when Siuan was deposed. After coming to Salidar, [Nynaeve](#el-Nynaeve-ti-al-Meara-Mandragoran) discovered how to restore Siuan's ability to channel, at least partially. This resurrected a part of her bond with Alric, but did not bring back her former strength, or her binding by the Oath Rod. She could lie as well as any child, at least until she re-swore the Three Oaths shortly before the Tower was reunited. She served as an advisor of sorts to the new Amyrlin in Salidar, [Egwene al'Vere](#Egwene-al-Vere), but though she put on a façade of hating the work, she was actually one of Egwene's foremost agents. The fact that she was Aes Sedai, not to mention one who was stilled and Healed again, made other sisters tend to be oblivious to that fact. She was pushed very hard by Elaida as a novice. While Egwene was being held prisoner in the Tower, Siuan was charged with keeping the factions among the rebels—headed by [Romanda Cassin](#Romanda-Cassin) and [Lelaine Akashi](#Lelaine-Akashi), respectively—from usurping the rebellion and placing _themselves_ on the Amyrlin Seat. When the Seanchan attacked, Siuan decided she had had enough of Egwene's stubborn insistance not to rescue her. She easily convinced [Gawyn](#Gawyn-Trakand) to come with her, and eventually convinced Gareth Bryne to come with as well, on two conditions: she bond Bryne as her Warder, which she did immediately, and that she marry him. The second condition has yet to be met. Bryne saved her life when a Seanchan assassin creeped up behind her while she was Healing Bryne's troops; he thrust his sword into the apparition's chest area, knowing that he would die if the blow did not land, and saved her life. She then saved _his_ life by Healing him of the poison the assassin injected right before dying himself, thus satisfying Min's viewing. Siuan has an unusual Talent: she can see _ta'veren_."

His story could have been drawn from legends: he had lain wounded for hours before managing to pull himself into the saddle by the reins; the horse carried him, nearly unconscious, for hours before arriving at a village, where the villagers had been tempted to sell him to a group of bandits. The mayor's daughter argued for his life, convincing everyone that only Darkfriends would seek wounded Warders. The villagers hid him, and the girl nursed him to health. He was forced to leave in secret, as the girl had taken a liking to him, but in return he hunted down the bandits and killed them so they would never trouble the village again. Hattori told him she would not take a second Warder unless Sleete believed the person to be worthy. He is one of the only Warders to have ever bettered [Lan Mandragoran](#al-Lan-Mandragoran), back when Lan still practiced with the other Warders. Sleete beat Lan in two of their seven duels, and Lan is widely considered the best Warder and Blademaster in the world.

The Seat is traditionally held by a woman strong both in the Power and in her character. The vote to choose an Amyrlin must be unanimous, as must the vote to depose one. Once chosen, the Amyrlin is said to be “of all Ajahs and none“—all previous affiliations with Ajah are ignored (at least in theory). The Ajahs have gotten fairly equal numbers of Amyrlins raised from their Ajah, with two exceptions. No Amyrlin had been raised from the Red Ajah since Bonwhin Meraighdin, who was deposed and stilled for nearly breaking the Tower in [Artur Hawkwing](#High-King-Artur-Hawkwing)'s day, except for [Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan](#Elaida-do-Avriny-a-Roihan), raised Amyrlin in Tar Valon after a coup deposed [Siuan Sanche](#Siuan-Sanche); the Blue Ajah has had more than the average number of Amyrlins from its Ajah—four of the last the last five Amyrlins (before Elaida) were raised from the Blue Ajah. These two exceptions to the mean number of Amyrlins from one's Ajah have only added to the friction between the Blue and Red Ajahs over the years. The Amyrlin has a secretary of sorts, the [Keeper of the Chronicles](#Keeper-of-the-Chronicles), who is traditionally chosen from the same Ajah that the Amyrlin was raised from. The Amyrlin Seat was held by [Siuan Sanche](#Siuan-Sanche), raised from the Blue Ajah, until she was deposed for her involvement with events surrounding the [Dragon Reborn](#Dragon-Reborn). Her successor was the leader of the coup, [Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan](#Elaida-do-Avriny-a-Roihan), raised from the Red Ajah. Siuan's deposition divided the Tower, and the faction opposing Elaida raised a new Amyrlin who could not be accused of choosing sides on the fateful day Siuan was deposed: [Egwene al'Vere](#Egwene-al-Vere), who was outside the Tower and not even a full sister from the time Siuan was deposed to the time Egwene was Raised. Other sisters outside the Tower, in many cases, did not reveal their loyalties to either Egwene or Elaida. Egwene was captured by forces loyal to Elaida during a partially successful attempt to turn the harbor chains to _cuendillar_; Elaida re-enlisted her as a Novice, and treated her as a disobedient, stubborn child. Egwene remained defiant to the very last, trying to garner support from within. Elaida stubbornly refused to acknowledge Egwene's warnings of a Seanchan attack; that very attack, when it occurred, claimed Elaida herself as a prisoner of the Seanchan. After two tense days, filled with revelations of the Black Ajah, the aftermath of the Seanchan attack, and a near-invasion by Egwene's army, the Hall Selected a new Amyrlin: Egwene al'Vere, raised from the Accepted (no Ajah)."

When Verin went to the Two Rivers with [Alanna](#Alanna-Mosvani), they helped to fight the Trollocs that attacked, and when they left they brought a half-dozen young women with them who could channel, including [Mat](#Matrim-Mat-Cauthon)'s sister Bode. When she and Alanna reached Caemlyn, they found that the Tower had been broken, and decided to side with the Salidar embassy when it reached town. Verin is quite old—her hair is starting to turn gray, which to an Aes Sedai means she is quite old indeed. She communicated with [Cadsuane](#Cadsuane-Melaidhrin)'s group of sisters in Tear, but has since departed their company. Verin always seems to follow her own agenda, though [Siuan](#Siuan-Sanche) once said she had always trusted her, even though she knew she could trust no one.

Known to virtually no one until an hour before her death, Verin was a member of the Black Ajah. She was given the choice one day to take her oaths to serve the Dark One or be executed. She took the oaths to save her own skin; once inducted, she carefully but persistently studied the Black Ajah—how it is organized, what its rules are, and, most importantly, who its members are. She found Tomas, who was a Darkfriend seeking a way out, and he agreed to become her Warder. She wrote down all of her notes, including a list of about 200 sisters she had discovered, in a dense tome that she gave to Egwene al'Vere after drinking poison. The poison would kill her in one hour, which released her from her oath: “I swear not to betray the [Great Lord](#Dark-One), to keep my secrets until the hour of my death.” Her bravery allowed Egwene to gut the Black Ajah among the rebels, starting with her [Keeper of the Chronicles](#Keeper-of-the-Chronicles), [Sheriam Bayanar](#Sheriam-Bayanar), and a Sitter for the Blue Ajah, Moria Karentanis. Verin also left a note with [Mat Cauthon](#Matrim-Mat-Cauthon) just before going to the Tower to spill her secret to Egwene; she made him promise not to open it until several days had passed, but that if he opened it he had to do what it said.

According to the terms of their vows as taken before the Sea Folk, one of them must obey in public while the other obeys in private; for obvious reasons, Nynaeve is the one who commands in public. Upon Moiraine's death, Lan's bond was immediately transferred to [Myrelle](#Myrelle-Berengari) until Nynaeve is ready to have his bond transferred to her. Myrelle tried to keep Lan's status secret, but she was given away when she tried to buy one of Lan's favorite foods, coin peppers, too far south (they are very popular in Shienar, and were in Malkier before it fell to the Blight, but do not grow well in southern climates). Upon learning of where Lan was, [Egwene](#Egwene-al-Vere) sent him to Ebou Dar to serve as a Warder for Nynaeve. He traveled with his wife and the group of Aes Sedai she accompanied until he started to feel longing for his homeland. Nynaeve understood that he needed to finish his fight in the Blight, but she vowed to increase his chance of survival by dropping him off at World's End in Saldaea and alerting every surviving Malkieri she could find that Lan was marching for Tarwin's Gap. According to the Wise Ones, _[Aan'allein](#Aan-allein)_ (as the Aiel call him) will die the day he learns that Nynaeve is dead. He is one of the best, if not _the_ best, warriors, swordsmen, and Warders in the world. Lan was determined to avoid all signs of civilization in the Borderlands, intending to ride to Tarwin's Gap himself. Nynaeve had other plans, however; she visited dozens of locations throughout the Borderlands and alerted any Malkieri she could find of Lan's mission. He still intends to turn as many of them away as he can, but he may have little choice in the matter."

    "chapter": "Prologue: Distinctions",
    "info": "Young woman from Emond's Field, now an Aes Sedai of the Yellow Ajah. She was the Wisdom of her village, the youngest such ever chosen in Emond's Field. She left when four of her villagers were taken away from the Two Rivers by [Moiraine](#Moiraine-Damodred) and [Lan](#al-Lan-Mandragoran). While the group traveled away from her home and toward her new life, Nynaeve made several discoveries: she could channel the One Power, and had already done so without really knowing what she was doing; she developed feelings for Lan Mandragoran, Moiraine's Warder and the uncrowned king of the now dead nation Malkier; and she has a major role to play, as all of her younger friends in the group do, in the years to come. She is very strong in the One Power; only a select few who were alive during the Age of Legends could match her as well as a few young women still being trained. When she arrived in Tar Valon, she was raised Accepted without any tenure as a novice, despite not being able to even _sense_ the True Source unless angry, a result of her having to learn some minimal control of her ability without teaching. She was sent on a false mission by Liandrin on which she was almost leashed by the Seanchan as [Egwene](#Egwene-al-Vere) was. After she returned to the Tower, [Siuan Sanche](#Siuan-Sanche) sent her on a mission to hunt down Liandrin and her fellow Black Sisters; while hunting them in Tanchico, she encountered [Moghedien](#Moghedien) and managed to better her in a duel of the Power. Moghedien escaped, but two encounters later Nynaeve once again managed to get the better of her, leashing her with an _a'dam_ in _Tel'aran'rhiod_. Nynaeve took Moghedien with her to seek out [Rand](#Rand-al-Thor) and [Rahvin](#Rahvin) while they were fighting each other, and at the last moment before Rahvin might have won, she nearly burned Rahvin to ash with a giant weave of fire that was most of what Moghedien could draw to produce it; the distraction was enough for Rand to regain control of himself and destroy Rahvin with balefire. Nynaeve then kept Moghedien under control with a modified _a'dam_ in Salidar until Halima helped her escape. Nynaeve wished to become Aes Sedai for the sole purpose of Healing; she thinks the Tower meddles in the affairs of nations far too much, and wants no part of it. She is determined to Heal anything short of death, and has already managed to Heal gentling. Nynaeve felt bad when Moiraine died, because her first thought was not of her, but that now Lan was free from their bond. She was not told that Lan's bond had been passed to [Myrelle](#Myrelle-Berengari) at the moment of Moiraine's death. She and Lan are now married, and the plan is for Lan's bond to pass to her as soon as she and Myrelle can get together. She now wears the _ki'sain_, an ornament traditionally worn by Malkieri wives, consisting of a dot on the forehead between the eyes—Lan did not tell her of this tradition, but when she found out, she immediately took it up. It is the one element of her appearance that never fades for one second when every other part changes faster than the eye can follow in _Tel'aran'rhiod_. Because she was the only person Rand felt he could trust to link with him and the Choedan Kal, he asked Nynaeve to assist him when he cleansed _saidin_. She now carries the _ter'angreal_ she found in Ebou Dar nearly all the time, making her collection of jewelry rival that of [Cadsuane](#Cadsuane-Melaidhrin). She is even rumored to leave much of this jewelry on even when sleeping. Nynaeve knew she could not prevent Lan from returning to the Blight to fight his one-man war, so she deposited him as far from Tarwin's Gap as possible while still remaining in the Borderlands, then alerted every surviving Malkieri she could find to Lan's mission."
