Bukama, his friend and teacher, soon joins him, and the two of them speak about the Aiel War that they are participating in.\nAs they walk, one of the sentries leads a nameless Tairen officer to them. The officer is there on behalf of one Lord Emares, who wishes to form an anvil and hammer to attack a group of five or six hundred Aiel. Lan agrees and sends Bukama off to awaken the men.\nThey set off, and soon they reach the Hook, a treeless crest that is less than forty feet high and a mile long that doubles back from the north to the south. It is here that Lan and his men will form the anvil. Lan finds himself hoping that the Aiel do not simply choose a spot and use their bows, since in this way he will lose a lot of men.\nWhen the Aiel appear, Lan sees that there are easily two thousand of them. Lan decides to stay where he is, because if Emares strikes without the anvil in place, the Tairens will be crushed. However, if Emares does not show up by the time the Aiel are within two hundred paces of Lan's men, he will get his men to try to ride around the Aiel warriors to join Emares.\nAt five hundred paces, the Aiel come to a stop. Raising their spears, they shout \"Aan'allein!\" which means \"One Man Alone\" in the Old Tongue. Lan and his men are all confused, even more so when the Aiel warriors veer to the east, not attacking them. Lan decides not to follow, but instead wishes to speak with Emares."

As Moiraine waits in the cold office, she thinks about the Aiel War, about the two Aes Sedai in the room, about why they seemed to be worried, and about her closest friend, Siuan. As she thinks specifically about how Gitara has the Talent of Foretelling, she wishes that she could be present during one of Gitara's Foretellings.\nSuddenly, outside, trumpets begin to blare. Tamra sends Moiraine to see if there is a message from the battlefield, and tells Siuan to make some tea. Moiraine exits the room into the anteroom, and speaks to Elin Warrel, the novice on duty. There have been no messages. When Moiraine returns, she joins Siuan where the other girl is preparing the tea, and takes a cup to Gitara. When Tamra sees her, she asks if there is any news. Before Moiraine can reply, Gitara jumps to her feet, her eyes wide with terror.\n\"He is born again!\" she says. \"I feel him! The Dragon takes his first breath on the slope of Dragonmount! He is coming! He is coming! Light help us! Light help the world! He lies in the snow and cries like the thunder! He burns like the sun!\" As she finishes speaking, Gitara falls forward into Moiraine's arms. Tamra is there in an instant, using the One Power to Delve and find out what is wrong with Gitara; she is dead.\nTamra orders horrified Moiraine and Siuan not to tell anyone that Gitara has just Foretold the birth of the Dragon Reborn, though she does not mention the word \"Dragon\". She then orders for Elin to be sent in to her, so that Tamra can tell her where to find Gitara's serving woman.\nAs Moiraine and Siuan leave the room, Moiraine thinks to herself, \"I wished to hear a Foretelling, and what I received was a Foretelling of doom.\""

They decide to skip breakfast as they both feel as if they couldn't eat a thing and head towards the Accepted quarters. In Siuan's room, they begin to practice for the Aes Sedai test, with Siuan attempting to make Moiraine lose her concentration. After a little while, Myrelle enters the room and joins in their practicing. Together, Siuan and Myrelle do a good job of distracting Moiraine.\nTarna Feir, another Accepted, arrives and tells the three other girls that the Amyrlin Seat has summoned the Accepted to the Oval Lecture Hall, and also tells them that Gitara died.\nWhen the four of them reach the Lecture Hall, all of the other Accepted are already there, all of them gossiping about why Tamra wishes to speak to them. One girl thinks that they are all to be tested immediately for the shawl, while another thinks that Gitara had a Foretelling about the end of the White Tower, so they are all going to be sent home.\nWhen Tamra enters the room, she puts all of these rumors to rest. She announces to them all that, in thanksgiving for the continued safety of Tar Valon, the Tower will be awarding each woman in the city and surrounding area who has recently had a child with one hundred crowns. As there are no available Aes Sedai around, she is sending them into the camps nearest to the city to record information on each child that has been born. Each Accepted will be accompanied by four guards. She warns them to be careful, as there are Whitecloaks with the army.\nAs the Accepted leave, Moiraine and Siuan are both very excited. They know that Tamra wishes to find the Dragon Reborn."

When Moiraine is done, she joins Siuan, and they hurry towards the West Stable. Once they mount their horses, eight guards led by a man named Steler are assigned to accompany the two of them.\nThey begin to make their way through the city, seeing people from every country as they go. The city is alive and very noisy, as if there hadn't been a battle outside the walls. Moiraine even sees some Ogier stonemasons repairing buildings.\nFinally, they reach the Alindaer Gate and proceed to exit the city. As they begin to ride across the bridge, they see a group of nine or ten Whitecloaks at the foot of the bridge. They sit for a moment, and then turn and ride away.\nOnce off the bridge, Siuan attempts to make Steler take them to the farthest camps, the ones that just happen to be the nearest to Dragonmount, but he refuses. They ride past a camp where one Accepted, Sarene, is already taking names, but stop at the next one. Once Steler announces their purpose, a table, two stools and two braziers are set up."

At first, women seethe around them in a very disorderly manner, until Siuan weaves Air and Fire to enhance her voice and orders them to be quiet. There are women from all stations in life, from noblewomen to farmers' wives. One of the women, Susa Wynn, has a child that is too old to have been born recently, but Moiraine writes her name down anyway. Susa is very thin and most likely starving, and her child is sick. Feeling sympathy for the woman, Moiraine gives her money so that she can take her son to a Wise Woman.\nSome time later, once noon has passed and Moiraine and Siuan have eaten, two Aes Sedai, Meilyn and Elaida, show up, effectively ruining the camp's belief that Moiraine and Siuan are Aes Sedai. Meilyn reminds them to be back at the Tower before dark, and then she and Elaida leave.\nThe women waiting in line are now not nearly as respectful as they had been earlier, and several times Moiraine and Siuan have to shout and threaten. When they get down to about a dozen women, Steler tells them that it is time to leave. Women from the camp hold him and the other guards back while Moiraine and Siuan quickly finish.\nThey manage to get back to the Tower before sunset. In the Accepted's quarters, Katerine Alruddin, another Accepted, is waiting for them, and tells Moiraine that Merean, the Mistress of Novices, wishes to see her. When Moiraine arrives at Merean's study, she is told that three of her uncles, King Laman and two of his brothers, were killed that day. Merean also says that because of this, Moiraine does not have to go out the next day. Moiraine argues that if she stays behind, she will be alone, but Merean is still doubtful. Upon returning to her room, Moiraine skips supper and instead prays for her uncles' souls.\nThat night, she has nightmares about the Dragon Reborn. She ends up spending the rest of the night in Siuan's room."

So that her mind isn't left unoccupied, she will be put to work copying out the messier lists of names. When Siuan agrees that Moiraine should stay behind, Merean tells her that she can keep Moiraine company. Siuan tells Moiraine that this way they get to look at all of the lists, and that maybe they can find the Dragon Reborn. The two of them eat breakfast and then get to work. Moiraine is worried since a lot of the information is very vague, such as \"born within sight of Tar Valon's walls.\"\nThe next morning, Moiraine and Siuan continue their work, though no one said that they had to. Shortly after, two clerks walk in, and the elder remarks that she dislikes \"being set a task only to learn someone else is already performing it.\" They leave, and minutes later, Tamra appears. She tells them that they may continue if they wish.\nAbout an hour later, Moiraine comes across a likely entry, and writes it down on a separate piece of paper for later use. Siuan is also writing likely names down in a small book.\nShortly after midmorning, one of the Gray Sitters, Jarna Malari, appears and tells Moiraine to come walk with her. Jarna questions Moiraine about who she thinks will become the next king or queen of Cairhien.\nThroughout the day, six more Sitters, one from each Ajah, each speak with Moiraine. Tsutama, one of the Red Sitters, asks outright if Moiraine has ever thought of being queen of Cairhien herself. This just gives Moiraine more nightmares.\nWhereas before, Moiraine had not thought herself ready to be tested for Aes Sedai, she now wants to be tested as soon as possible. She decides that she will leave the Tower as soon as she is raised to Aes Sedai, until the whole Cairhien issue has blown over."

Waiting in the room are the three Sitters of every Ajah, as well as two other sisters from every Ajah, each with a shawl over her arm in case Moiraine or Siuan choose their Ajah.\nAfter a bit of ritual talk (stating names and reasons for being there, etc.), first Moiraine and then Siuan swear the Three Oaths. Once that is done, both of them choose the Blue Ajah and receive their shawls. All of the Blue Sisters in the room welcome them. Eadyth, one of the Sitters, charges Leane Sharif and Rafela Cindal, the two non-Sitter Blues, with the task of escorting Moiraine and Siuan to the Blue quarters. When they arrive, they find every Blue sister currently in Tar Valon wrapped in their shawls and lining the main corridor."

The order said to lay open Moiraine's finances to him. Luckily for Moiraine, Mistress Dormaile, the banker, had him imprisoned, although he later escaped.\nWanting to be prepared, Moiraine begins to lay down plans, not to run away, but to be ready.\nLater, Moiraine and Siuan visit a dressmaker named Tamore Alkohima. Moiraine ends up ordering twenty dresses, though Siuan only gets six. Siuan complains about the price, and Moiraine can tell that Tamore is displeased; she knows that Tamore will find a way to get back at Siuan for it (and at Moiraine for keeping her waiting while she spoke to Siuan about it), most likely by making the gowns very snug and revealing, as well as in a very light color, at least for Moiraine. Moiraine also orders four dark, Cairhienin-style riding dresses.\nMoiraine is quite pleased with the day, however. She thinks that the number of dresses she has ordered will make the Hall think that she plans on staying at the Tower for a long while. Moiraine thinks to herself that, for the moment, she is as ready as she can be."

This includes things such as the Warder Bond, the trick for ignoring heat and cold, and Ajah secrets. At the same time, Siuan is still working for Cetalia Delarme, something about which she complains a lot.\nAbout a week after Moiraine and Siuan are raised to Aes Sedai, Ellid is summoned for her test, but does not return from the ter'angreal. Another week later, Sheriam is summoned, passes, and chooses the Blue Ajah.\nA few days later, it is announced that Tamra has died in her sleep. Moiraine thinks that perhaps the new Amyrlin Seat will free her from the job of handing out the bounty, and then is immediately disgusted that that is all she can think about. As a penance, she forces herself to wear the lightest color of dress that Tamore sends to her, a blue so pale that it is nearly white. It is also snugly cut, and earns Moiraine stares from many of the other Sisters. At Tamra's funeral, many of the Aes Sedai, including Moiraine, speak.\nThe evening after Tamra's funeral, Sierin Vayu of the Gray Ajah is raised to the Amyrlin Seat. She is a very strict woman, but she does let Moiraine off from the bounty job. However, she also commands that Moiraine stay in Tar Valon.\nNevertheless, Moiraine still plans to leave. She says goodbye to Siuan and then heads out into the city. First, she visits Mistress Dormaile, her banker, where she takes out two hundred gold and silver crowns, as well as several letters-of-rights. Her next stop is at Tamore's dress shop, where she picks up her Cairhienin-style riding dresses. She hires porters and buys everything that she needs before buying passage on a ship named Bluewing. As the ship pulls out of harbor, she catches sight of a tall man staring after her. He fits Mistress Dormaile's description of the Cairhienin man who tried to get access to Moiraine's finances.\nAs the ship continues to sail away, Moiraine thinks about how she has now passed into disobedience to the Amyrlin Seat."

They go to a table and sit down. A serving maid named Lira brings them wine, and gives Lan an invitation to spend the night with her.\nLan and Ryne talk about a few things, including the fact that a woman named Edeyn Arrel, who was Lan's first lover, has raised the Golden Crane (Malkier's flag) in Lan's name. There are several hundred men in Canluum alone ready to follow her and Lan. With a lot to think about, Lan goes out to the stable and paces for a while, thinking about Edeyn and Malkier as he does so. Eventually, he sits down and assumes the ko'di, calming himself.\nBukama shows up and tells Lan that he has heard about the Golden Crane and Edeyn. When they leave the stable, there are six men walking towards them. Lan knows even before they draw their swords that they are going to attack him and Bukama. Since Bukama not only doesn't have his sword with him but has sworn an oath to keep the peace, Lan orders him back into the stable, and Bukama obeys. Lan then goes to meet the six attackers.\nLan assumes the ko'di once again, they begin to fight. He relieves one man of his left eye, and receives a gash across his ribs from another man. Lan slices off another man's left arm, and is rewarded with a nick near his own eye from the same man who cut him before. Lan knows that the only reasonable outcome will be for him to die, but he fights anyway; his duty is to Bukama, who is not able to fight for himself while in Canluum. He kicks in the head of the man who has wounded him, and continues to fight the men while suffering injuries himself.\nWhen Lan finally stops, he realizes that all of the six attackers are now dead. People begin to flood out of the inn, demanding to know what has happened. Lira and Bukama both run to Lan, checking on his injuries. Racelle Arovni sends a woman for the Watch.\nRyne also goes to Lan, and remarks that two of the attackers had been men who had listened to Edeyn. For this reason, he thinks that perhaps Edeyn was behind the attack. She has raised the Golden Crane in Lan's name, but with Lan dead, she could be Queen of Malkier. Lan is angry with Ryne for saying this, not because he doesn't believe Edeyn capable of it, but because there are strangers around.\nBukama asks Lan where they will be going now, and Lan replies that they will go to Chachin.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

The only thing she can think of is that Siuan has let something slip to Sierin, and that it would be just like the Amyrlin to send Siuan after her so that they can worry about their punishment together on the long ride back to the White Tower.\nWhen they finally meet in an alley, Siuan says, \"Light, I thought I'd never bloody find you. Tell me you've found him, Moiraine. Tell me the Najima boy's the one, and we can hand him to the Tower with a hundred sisters watching, and it's done.\"\nWhen Moiraine inquires as to what's wrong, Siuan tells her what has happened. All of Tamra's searchers are dead. Aisha, Kerene, Valera, Ludice and Meilyn. The story is that Aisha and her Warder were killed by bandits in Murandy, and that Kerene had fallen off a ship during a storm on the Alguenya. Siuan then tells Moiraine that she had gone to speak to Meilyn after hearing about all of the others. She had waited in Meilyn's room, underneath the bed so that no one would see her. Meilyn never came. The next morning, it was announced that Meilyn had died in her sleep.

Moiraine quickly weaves shields of Air in front of Lan and herself, and then wraps the assassin in flows of Air; she had just meant to keep him from shooting again, but Bukama and Ryne use this chance to loose arrows of their own.

Caniedrin dies after telling them that he had been paid to kill them. \"Gold. Why else? You still have the Dark One's luck turning just then or that shaft would have found your heart.

On the way, she sees Bukama and Ryne practice fighting in a courtyard, and thinks that now she will have to avoid them and Lan.\nShe meets and spends some time talking with Brys and members of his family. She learns here that Lan is actually the king of lost Malkier, and is shocked. She pretends that she is unwell and is led back to her rooms by a serving girl named Elis. On the way, she runs across Merean, who has just arrived at the palace. She and Merean exchange a few words, and Elis realizes that Moiraine is also Aes Sedai. Moiraine commands Elis to take her to Lan's apartments, and Elis obeys.\nOnce in Lan's apartments, Moiraine announces that she wants him to do something for her. \"There was a pledge made, and held since the War of the Hundred Years, that Malkier would ride when the White Tower called. I am Aes Sedai, and I call you!\"\nLan replies that he will help her if she answers a question for him. His question is this: \"When Malkier died, Shienar and Arafel sent men. They could not stop the flood of Trollocs and Myrddraal, yet they came. Men rode from Kandor, and even Saldaea. They came too late, but they came. For nine hundred years we rode when the White Tower called, but where was the Tower when Malkier died? If you are Aes Sedai, answer me that!\"\nAs it happens, the answer to that question is Sealed to the Tower, but Moiraine tells him the truth anyway. Over a hundred sisters were sent to Malkier, but they arrived too late. The White Tower felt that it was better for their reputation for others to think that the Tower had done nothing than to have it known that Aes Sedai had tried and failed.\nLan accepts the answer and asks Moiraine what she wants. She wants him to have someone watch Merean, to note where she goes, what she does, and who she meets. They agree that Bukama will watch Merean, and that he will report to Moiraine's maid, Suki (Siuan).\nWhen Moiraine returns to her rooms, it is to find that Iselle Arrel is waiting for her. She demands that she be taken to the Tower since she has the ability to channel, but Moiraine tells her to go by herself if she wishes, and has Siuan show her out. When Moiraine tells Siuan that Bukama will be watching Merean, Siuan is upset that Moiraine has taken such a risk. Siuan tells Moiraine that an old man (Bukama) approached her that day, asked if she was Suki, and then let her know that Merean spent most of the day with Brys.\nSiuan then tells Moiraine what she has learned from Cal. Ines Demain's son, Rahien, was born the day after Gitara's Foretelling, making it even more likely that he is the Dragon Reborn. Siuan also informs Moiraine that she will be moving in with Ines Demain's servants. She has led Cal to believe that she has been dismissed from Moiraine's service for spilling wine on her, and Cal thinks that he can get her a job working for Ines.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

That leaves only Moiraine.\nMoiraine is now convinced that Merean is of the Black Ajah, and tells Lan that if he cares at all for Iselle he will keep her away from Merean. Lan replies that all Aes Sedai are dangerous; besides, he just saw Iselle hurrying by with Brys and Diryk.\nMoiraine's mind is racing now, thinking of Merean with Iselle, and Iselle with Brys and Diryk. Suddenly, she asks Lan where Brys would go for privacy, and tells him to take her there.\nTogether, Moiraine and Lan hurry to Brys' private balcony. When they get there, Iselle is speaking to Merean, and Brys and Diryk are standing by the rail of the balcony, wrapped in flows of Air. Moiraine lashes out at Merean with a shield of Spirit, but the shield splinters.\nRyne is also there, and Moiraine now knows that he is a Darkfriend. Merean tells Ryne that he did a good job of killing the spy (Bukama), and tells him to take care of Lan. Merean then wraps Iselle up in flows of Air and turns to take care of Moiraine, attacking with her own shield of Spirit.\nAs Lan and Ryne begin to fight, Moiraine and Merean are engaged in their own battle with the One Power, each trying to shield the other; at the same time, Moiraine is trying to free Brys, Diryk and Iselle. As they battle, Merean speaks to Moiraine about how if she wounds her, she will Heal her so that she can question her.\nAfter a little while, Merean says, \"This is taking too long, don't you think, child?\" With that, she lifts Diryk into the air and drifts him over the railing. Moiraine screams as Diryk falls to his death, and white light explodes in Moiraine's head.\nWhen Moiraine opens her eyes, a couple of minutes have passed. She feels very groggy and is shielded by Merean. Lan and Ryne are still fighting, and Brys is staring in hatred at his son's murderess, Merean.\nBrys is the next to go over the railing. Moiraine struggles to her feet with determination. As Merean lifts Iselle into the air, Moiraine lunges towards Merean and stabs her in the back with her belt knife. In shock, Merean lets the shield on Moiraine drop, and Moiraine scrambles towards Iselle, who is teetering atop the stone railing, screaming. As Iselle slips and starts to fall, Moiraine grabs her hand, but cannot pull her up. She is also unable to grasp the Source, but she is determined to save at least one person.\nHowever, Iselle's hand slips from her grasp. As Moiraine watches Iselle fall, Lan pulls her away. \"Never watch a death you don't have to,\" he tells her. He is wounded, but alive.\nOnce Moiraine is able to walk again, she goes over to Merean and sees Ryne lying on the ground dead. Once she is able to embrace the Source, she Heals Lan. She then burns Merean's body, telling Lan that there is no proof that she was Black Ajah, only that she was Aes Sedai.\n\"You are a very hard woman,\" Lan tells her. Moiraine replies, \"I am as hard as I must be.\"\n<< Previous Chapter / Next Chapter >>"

Lan is said to be the luckiest man in the world; Diryk recently survived a fall that should have killed him.
