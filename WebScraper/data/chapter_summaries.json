Bukama, his friend and teacher, soon joins him, and the two of them speak about the Aiel War that they are participating in.\nAs they walk, one of the sentries leads a nameless Tairen officer to them. The officer is there on behalf of one Lord Emares, who wishes to form an anvil and hammer to attack a group of five or six hundred Aiel. Lan agrees and sends Bukama off to awaken the men.\nThey set off, and soon they reach the Hook, a treeless crest that is less than forty feet high and a mile long that doubles back from the north to the south. It is here that Lan and his men will form the anvil. Lan finds himself hoping that the Aiel do not simply choose a spot and use their bows, since in this way he will lose a lot of men.\nWhen the Aiel appear, Lan sees that there are easily two thousand of them. Lan decides to stay where he is, because if Emares strikes without the anvil in place, the Tairens will be crushed. However, if Emares does not show up by the time the Aiel are within two hundred paces of Lan's men, he will get his men to try to ride around the Aiel warriors to join Emares.\nAt five hundred paces, the Aiel come to a stop. Raising their spears, they shout \"Aan'allein!\" which means \"One Man Alone\" in the Old Tongue. Lan and his men are all confused, even more so when the Aiel warriors veer to the east, not attacking them. Lan decides not to follow, but instead wishes to speak with Emares."

As Moiraine waits in the cold office, she thinks about the Aiel War, about the two Aes Sedai in the room, about why they seemed to be worried, and about her closest friend, Siuan. As she thinks specifically about how Gitara has the Talent of Foretelling, she wishes that she could be present during one of Gitara's Foretellings.\nSuddenly, outside, trumpets begin to blare. Tamra sends Moiraine to see if there is a message from the battlefield, and tells Siuan to make some tea. Moiraine exits the room into the anteroom, and speaks to Elin Warrel, the novice on duty. There have been no messages. When Moiraine returns, she joins Siuan where the other girl is preparing the tea, and takes a cup to Gitara. When Tamra sees her, she asks if there is any news. Before Moiraine can reply, Gitara jumps to her feet, her eyes wide with terror.\n\"He is born again!\" she says. \"I feel him! The Dragon takes his first breath on the slope of Dragonmount! He is coming! He is coming! Light help us! Light help the world! He lies in the snow and cries like the thunder! He burns like the sun!\" As she finishes speaking, Gitara falls forward into Moiraine's arms. Tamra is there in an instant, using the One Power to Delve and find out what is wrong with Gitara; she is dead.\nTamra orders horrified Moiraine and Siuan not to tell anyone that Gitara has just Foretold the birth of the Dragon Reborn, though she does not mention the word \"Dragon\". She then orders for Elin to be sent in to her, so that Tamra can tell her where to find Gitara's serving woman.\nAs Moiraine and Siuan leave the room, Moiraine thinks to herself, \"I wished to hear a Foretelling, and what I received was a Foretelling of doom.\""

They decide to skip breakfast as they both feel as if they couldn't eat a thing and head towards the Accepted quarters. In Siuan's room, they begin to practice for the Aes Sedai test, with Siuan attempting to make Moiraine lose her concentration. After a little while, Myrelle enters the room and joins in their practicing. Together, Siuan and Myrelle do a good job of distracting Moiraine.\nTarna Feir, another Accepted, arrives and tells the three other girls that the Amyrlin Seat has summoned the Accepted to the Oval Lecture Hall, and also tells them that Gitara died.\nWhen the four of them reach the Lecture Hall, all of the other Accepted are already there, all of them gossiping about why Tamra wishes to speak to them. One girl thinks that they are all to be tested immediately for the shawl, while another thinks that Gitara had a Foretelling about the end of the White Tower, so they are all going to be sent home.\nWhen Tamra enters the room, she puts all of these rumors to rest. She announces to them all that, in thanksgiving for the continued safety of Tar Valon, the Tower will be awarding each woman in the city and surrounding area who has recently had a child with one hundred crowns. As there are no available Aes Sedai around, she is sending them into the camps nearest to the city to record information on each child that has been born. Each Accepted will be accompanied by four guards. She warns them to be careful, as there are Whitecloaks with the army.\nAs the Accepted leave, Moiraine and Siuan are both very excited.

Once they mount their horses, eight guards led by a man named Steler are assigned to accompany the two of them.\nThey begin to make their way through the city, seeing people from every country as they go. The city is alive and very noisy, as if there hadn't been a battle outside the walls. Moiraine even sees some Ogier stonemasons repairing buildings.\nFinally, they reach the Alindaer Gate and proceed to exit the city. As they begin to ride across the bridge, they see a group of nine or ten Whitecloaks at the foot of the bridge. They sit for a moment, and then turn and ride away.\nOnce off the bridge, Siuan attempts to make Steler take them to the farthest camps, the ones that just happen to be the nearest to Dragonmount, but he refuses. They ride past a camp where one Accepted, Sarene, is already taking names, but stop at the next one. Once Steler announces their purpose, a table, two stools and two braziers are set up."

At first, women seethe around them in a very disorderly manner, until Siuan weaves Air and Fire to enhance her voice and orders them to be quiet. There are women from all stations in life, from noblewomen to farmers' wives. One of the women, Susa Wynn, has a child that is too old to have been born recently, but Moiraine writes her name down anyway. Susa is very thin and most likely starving, and her child is sick. Feeling sympathy for the woman, Moiraine gives her money so that she can take her son to a Wise Woman.\nSome time later, once noon has passed and Moiraine and Siuan have eaten, two Aes Sedai, Meilyn and Elaida, show up, effectively ruining the camp's belief that Moiraine and Siuan are Aes Sedai. Meilyn reminds them to be back at the Tower before dark, and then she and Elaida leave.\nThe women waiting in line are now not nearly as respectful as they had been earlier, and several times Moiraine and Siuan have to shout and threaten. When they get down to about a dozen women, Steler tells them that it is time to leave. Women from the camp hold him and the other guards back while Moiraine and Siuan quickly finish.\nThey manage to get back to the Tower before sunset. In the Accepted's quarters, Katerine Alruddin, another Accepted, is waiting for them, and tells Moiraine that Merean, the Mistress of Novices, wishes to see her. When Moiraine arrives at Merean's study, she is told that three of her uncles, King Laman and two of his brothers, were killed that day. Merean also says that because of this, Moiraine does not have to go out the next day. Moiraine argues that if she stays behind, she will be alone, but Merean is still doubtful. Upon returning to her room, Moiraine skips supper and instead prays for her uncles' souls.\nThat night, she has nightmares about the Dragon Reborn. She ends up spending the rest of the night in Siuan's room."

They quickly get ready to leave.\nMerean appears and announces to Moiraine that the Amyrlin agrees that Moiraine should stay behind today. So that her mind isn't left unoccupied, she will be put to work copying out the messier lists of names. When Siuan agrees that Moiraine should stay behind, Merean tells her that she can keep Moiraine company. Siuan tells Moiraine that this way they get to look at all of the lists, and that maybe they can find the Dragon Reborn. The two of them eat breakfast and then get to work. Moiraine is worried since a lot of the information is very vague, such as \"born within sight of Tar Valon's walls.\"\nThe next morning, Moiraine and Siuan continue their work, though no one said that they had to. Shortly after, two clerks walk in, and the elder remarks that she dislikes \"being set a task only to learn someone else is already performing it.\" They leave, and minutes later, Tamra appears. She tells them that they may continue if they wish.\nAbout an hour later, Moiraine comes across a likely entry, and writes it down on a separate piece of paper for later use. Siuan is also writing likely names down in a small book.\nShortly after midmorning, one of the Gray Sitters, Jarna Malari, appears and tells Moiraine to come walk with her. Jarna questions Moiraine about who she thinks will become the next king or queen of Cairhien.\nThroughout the day, six more Sitters, one from each Ajah, each speak with Moiraine. Tsutama, one of the Red Sitters, asks outright if Moiraine has ever thought of being queen of Cairhien herself. This just gives Moiraine more nightmares.\nWhereas before, Moiraine had not thought herself ready to be tested for Aes Sedai, she now wants to be tested as soon as possible. She decides that she will leave the Tower as soon as she is raised to Aes Sedai, until the whole Cairhien issue has blown over."

This includes things such as the Warder Bond, the trick for ignoring heat and cold, and Ajah secrets. At the same time, Siuan is still working for Cetalia Delarme, something about which she complains a lot.\nAbout a week after Moiraine and Siuan are raised to Aes Sedai, Ellid is summoned for her test, but does not return from the ter'angreal. Another week later, Sheriam is summoned, passes, and chooses the Blue Ajah.\nA few days later, it is announced that Tamra has died in her sleep. Moiraine thinks that perhaps the new Amyrlin Seat will free her from the job of handing out the bounty, and then is immediately disgusted that that is all she can think about. As a penance, she forces herself to wear the lightest color of dress that Tamore sends to her, a blue so pale that it is nearly white. It is also snugly cut, and earns Moiraine stares from many of the other Sisters. At Tamra's funeral, many of the Aes Sedai, including Moiraine, speak.\nThe evening after Tamra's funeral, Sierin Vayu of the Gray Ajah is raised to the Amyrlin Seat. She is a very strict woman, but she does let Moiraine off from the bounty job. However, she also commands that Moiraine stay in Tar Valon.\nNevertheless, Moiraine still plans to leave. She says goodbye to Siuan and then heads out into the city. First, she visits Mistress Dormaile, her banker, where she takes out two hundred gold and silver crowns, as well as several letters-of-rights. Her next stop is at Tamore's dress shop, where she picks up her Cairhienin-style riding dresses. She hires porters and buys everything that she needs before buying passage on a ship named Bluewing. As the ship pulls out of harbor, she catches sight of a tall man staring after her. He fits Mistress Dormaile's description of the Cairhienin man who tried to get access to Moiraine's finances.\nAs the ship continues to sail away, Moiraine thinks about how she has now passed into disobedience to the Amyrlin Seat."

The innkeeper is a handsome graying woman; as soon as she sees Lan and Bukama, she strides towards them and kisses Bukama, snapping at him that it has been six years without a word.\nWhile Bukama is otherwise occupied, a man named Ryne Venamar, an old friend, approaches Lan. They go to a table and sit down. A serving maid named Lira brings them wine, and gives Lan an invitation to spend the night with her.\nLan and Ryne talk about a few things, including the fact that a woman named Edeyn Arrel, who was Lan's first lover, has raised the Golden Crane (Malkier's flag) in Lan's name. There are several hundred men in Canluum alone ready to follow her and Lan. With a lot to think about, Lan goes out to the stable and paces for a while, thinking about Edeyn and Malkier as he does so. Eventually, he sits down and assumes the ko'di, calming himself.\nBukama shows up and tells Lan that he has heard about the Golden Crane and Edeyn. When they leave the stable, there are six men walking towards them. Lan knows even before they draw their swords that they are going to attack him and Bukama. Since Bukama not only doesn't have his sword with him but has sworn an oath to keep the peace, Lan orders him back into the stable, and Bukama obeys. Lan then goes to meet the six attackers.\nLan assumes the ko'di once again, they begin to fight. He relieves one man of his left eye, and receives a gash across his ribs from another man. Lan slices off another man's left arm, and is rewarded with a nick near his own eye from the same man who cut him before. Lan knows that the only reasonable outcome will be for him to die, but he fights anyway; his duty is to Bukama, who is not able to fight for himself while in Canluum. He kicks in the head of the man who has wounded him, and continues to fight the men while suffering injuries himself.\nWhen Lan finally stops, he realizes that all of the six attackers are now dead. People begin to flood out of the inn, demanding to know what has happened. Lira and Bukama both run to Lan, checking on his injuries. Racelle Arovni sends a woman for the Watch.\nRyne also goes to Lan, and remarks that two of the attackers had been men who had listened to Edeyn. For this reason, he thinks that perhaps Edeyn was behind the attack. She has raised the Golden Crane in Lan's name, but with Lan dead, she could be Queen of Malkier. Lan is angry with Ryne for saying this, not because he doesn't believe Edeyn capable of it, but because there are strangers around.\nBukama asks Lan where they will be going now, and Lan replies that they will go to Chachin.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

Looking out the door into the street, she catches sight of a woman who looks like Siuan, and thinks that if you wish for something hard enough, you could think you saw it. When the woman peeks into the inn again, she realizes that it is indeed Siuan and hurries out of the inn. She follows Siuan a ways, all the while wondering why she is in Canluum. The only thing she can think of is that Siuan has let something slip to Sierin, and that it would be just like the Amyrlin to send Siuan after her so that they can worry about their punishment together on the long ride back to the White Tower.\nWhen they finally meet in an alley, Siuan says, \"Light, I thought I'd never bloody find you. Tell me you've found him, Moiraine. Tell me the Najima boy's the one, and we can hand him to the Tower with a hundred sisters watching, and it's done.\"\nWhen Moiraine inquires as to what's wrong, Siuan tells her what has happened. All of Tamra's searchers are dead. Aisha, Kerene, Valera, Ludice and Meilyn. The story is that Aisha and her Warder were killed by bandits in Murandy, and that Kerene had fallen off a ship during a storm on the Alguenya. Siuan then tells Moiraine that she had gone to speak to Meilyn after hearing about all of the others. She had waited in Meilyn's room, underneath the bed so that no one would see her. Meilyn never came. The next morning, it was announced that Meilyn had died in her sleep. As there were no marks on her body, and no poison used, Siuan knows that Meilyn had to have died by the One Power. She then goes on to remind Moiraine that Tamra had died in her sleep as well, and that the fact that Tamra and all of her searchers were dead was too big a coincidence. They come to the conclusion that it had to have been the Black Ajah. They both decide that Tamra must have been put to the question by the Black Ajah, and under the force had revealed the names of her searchers.\nMoiraine tells Siuan about her encounter with Cadsuane. They do not know what to think; Cadsuane could be of the Black Ajah, but she could also be one of Tamra's searchers that they didn't know about.\nThey come up with a plan. Siuan will ride on to Chachin. Moiraine will wait until Cadsuane has checked on her, and then also ride towards Chachin, where they will meet up again.\nMoiraine returns to the Gates of Heaven. Later that night, as promised, Cadsuane checks on Moiraine and finds her in her bed. Once Cadsuane has left, Moiraine gets up. She leaves her saddlebags behind, because if anyone sees her, they will arouse suspicion. She then leaves her room.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

On the way, she sees Bukama and Ryne practice fighting in a courtyard, and thinks that now she will have to avoid them and Lan.\nShe meets and spends some time talking with Brys and members of his family. She learns here that Lan is actually the king of lost Malkier, and is shocked. She pretends that she is unwell and is led back to her rooms by a serving girl named Elis. On the way, she runs across Merean, who has just arrived at the palace. She and Merean exchange a few words, and Elis realizes that Moiraine is also Aes Sedai. Moiraine commands Elis to take her to Lan's apartments, and Elis obeys.\nOnce in Lan's apartments, Moiraine announces that she wants him to do something for her. \"There was a pledge made, and held since the War of the Hundred Years, that Malkier would ride when the White Tower called. I am Aes Sedai, and I call you!\"\nLan replies that he will help her if she answers a question for him. His question is this: \"When Malkier died, Shienar and Arafel sent men. They could not stop the flood of Trollocs and Myrddraal, yet they came. Men rode from Kandor, and even Saldaea. They came too late, but they came. For nine hundred years we rode when the White Tower called, but where was the Tower when Malkier died? If you are Aes Sedai, answer me that!\"\nAs it happens, the answer to that question is Sealed to the Tower, but Moiraine tells him the truth anyway. Over a hundred sisters were sent to Malkier, but they arrived too late. The White Tower felt that it was better for their reputation for others to think that the Tower had done nothing than to have it known that Aes Sedai had tried and failed.\nLan accepts the answer and asks Moiraine what she wants. She wants him to have someone watch Merean, to note where she goes, what she does, and who she meets. They agree that Bukama will watch Merean, and that he will report to Moiraine's maid, Suki (Siuan).\nWhen Moiraine returns to her rooms, it is to find that Iselle Arrel is waiting for her. She demands that she be taken to the Tower since she has the ability to channel, but Moiraine tells her to go by herself if she wishes, and has Siuan show her out. When Moiraine tells Siuan that Bukama will be watching Merean, Siuan is upset that Moiraine has taken such a risk. Siuan tells Moiraine that an old man (Bukama) approached her that day, asked if she was Suki, and then let her know that Merean spent most of the day with Brys.\nSiuan then tells Moiraine what she has learned from Cal. Ines Demain's son, Rahien, was born the day after Gitara's Foretelling, making it even more likely that he is the Dragon Reborn. Siuan also informs Moiraine that she will be moving in with Ines Demain's servants. She has led Cal to believe that she has been dismissed from Moiraine's service for spilling wine on her, and Cal thinks that he can get her a job working for Ines.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

He adds that at first he thought it was Merean, but the last time he saw her she was trailing after Iselle. That leaves only Moiraine.\nMoiraine is now convinced that Merean is of the Black Ajah, and tells Lan that if he cares at all for Iselle he will keep her away from Merean. Lan replies that all Aes Sedai are dangerous; besides, he just saw Iselle hurrying by with Brys and Diryk.\nMoiraine's mind is racing now, thinking of Merean with Iselle, and Iselle with Brys and Diryk. Suddenly, she asks Lan where Brys would go for privacy, and tells him to take her there.\nTogether, Moiraine and Lan hurry to Brys' private balcony. When they get there, Iselle is speaking to Merean, and Brys and Diryk are standing by the rail of the balcony, wrapped in flows of Air. Moiraine lashes out at Merean with a shield of Spirit, but the shield splinters.\nRyne is also there, and Moiraine now knows that he is a Darkfriend. Merean tells Ryne that he did a good job of killing the spy (Bukama), and tells him to take care of Lan. Merean then wraps Iselle up in flows of Air and turns to take care of Moiraine, attacking with her own shield of Spirit.\nAs Lan and Ryne begin to fight, Moiraine and Merean are engaged in their own battle with the One Power, each trying to shield the other; at the same time, Moiraine is trying to free Brys, Diryk and Iselle. As they battle, Merean speaks to Moiraine about how if she wounds her, she will Heal her so that she can question her.\nAfter a little while, Merean says, \"This is taking too long, don't you think, child?\" With that, she lifts Diryk into the air and drifts him over the railing. Moiraine screams as Diryk falls to his death, and white light explodes in Moiraine's head.\nWhen Moiraine opens her eyes, a couple of minutes have passed. She feels very groggy and is shielded by Merean. Lan and Ryne are still fighting, and Brys is staring in hatred at his son's murderess, Merean.\nBrys is the next to go over the railing. Moiraine struggles to her feet with determination. As Merean lifts Iselle into the air, Moiraine lunges towards Merean and stabs her in the back with her belt knife. In shock, Merean lets the shield on Moiraine drop, and Moiraine scrambles towards Iselle, who is teetering atop the stone railing, screaming. As Iselle slips and starts to fall, Moiraine grabs her hand, but cannot pull her up. She is also unable to grasp the Source, but she is determined to save at least one person.\nHowever, Iselle's hand slips from her grasp. As Moiraine watches Iselle fall, Lan pulls her away. \"Never watch a death you don't have to,\" he tells her. He is wounded, but alive.\nOnce Moiraine is able to walk again, she goes over to Merean and sees Ryne lying on the ground dead. Once she is able to embrace the Source, she Heals Lan. She then burns Merean's body, telling Lan that there is no proof that she was Black Ajah, only that she was Aes Sedai.\n\"You are a very hard woman,\" Lan tells her. Moiraine replies, \"I am as hard as I must be.\"\n<< Previous Chapter / Next Chapter >>"

She tells Siuan how Diryk was the one that Merean wanted to kill the most; it was Diryk that she told Iselle to bring to her, and Diryk that she killed first. Merean also tried to kill Lan. Lan is said to be the luckiest man in the world; Diryk recently survived a fall that should have killed him. She also mentions Josef Najima, from Canluum, who was always said to have been lucky, but who died in a fire.\nSiuan begins to think, pacing back and forth, when it comes to her. She says, \"She never went near Rahien, Moiraine. The Black Ajah knows the Dragon was Reborn, but they don't bloody know when! Maybe Tamra managed to keep it back, or maybe they were too rough and she died before they could pry it out of her. That has to be it! Light! They're killing any man or boy who might be able to channel! Oh, burn me, thousands could die, Moiraine. Tens of thousands.\"\nThey decide that Siuan will return to the White Tower, where she will have access to all of the Blue Ajah's eyes-and-ears reports, while Moiraine continues to search for the Dragon Reborn.\nSiuan mentions that Lan rode out an hour ago, and Moiraine says that she has unfinished business with the man.

The palace is smeared in soot and has scorch-marks on the walls, floors and ceiling as a result of the lighting and fires, which killed many. It had once been pretty, with bright murals, colorful tapestries and paintings and finely carved furnishing inlaid with ivory and gold.\nLews Therin calls for his wife, Ilyena without noticing the dead people on the floor. He's wearing what was once a fine cloak, on which is embroidered a circle half white and half black, the colors separated by a sinuous line. When he sees it in a mirror, he remembers that it meant something, but he can't remember what.\nThe air behind him ripples and shimmers, solidifying a black-clad man who calls Lews Therin 'Lord of the Morning' and says that he has come for him.\nLews Therin asks if he has the Voice, as it will soon be time for the Singing. He then calls for Ilyena to meet the guest, something that makes the man wonder if \"the taint already has you so far in its grip\".\nThe man tries to make him remember more, when Lews Therin recognizes the name Shai'tan as a dangerous one that is better left unspoken, but the man says that it isn't dangerous for him.\nWhen Lews Therin asks him who he is and what he wants, he presents himself as Elan Morin Tedronai, the Betrayer of Hope. That's what men named him just as Lews Therin was named the Dragon, but from now on people would call Lews Therin Kinslayer.\nAs Lews Therin again calls down the ruined hall for Ilyena, Elan Morin says that Lews Therin once stood first among the Servants, wore the ring of Tamyrlin, sat in the High Seat, summoned the Nine Rods of Dominion and once defeated him at the Gates of Paaran Disen. He then says that that he himself was never very skilled at Healing and that he follows a different power now. He then Heals Lews Therin, who screams of the pain while he staggers around. After some time the pain recedes, and he recognizes Ilyena, a golden-haired woman lying among the dead on the floor.\nElan Morin tries to make him serve the Great Lord of the Dark and says that he can make Ilyena live again. Lews Therin says that he will destroy Elan Morin for Ilyena's death, but he responds by reminding him on his futile attack made by him and his Hundred Companions, who tear the world apart as they talk, on the Great Lord.\nLews Therin looks around and sees faces he loved all slain by him. He then reaches out for the tainted saidin and Travels to a flat and empty landscape where he draws deeply of the Source as he remembers how he had believed in his pride, and while he shouts for forgiveness, a bolt of lightning and fire strikes from the heaven and through Lews Therin, making the earth heave while molten rock fountains high up in the air. When the earth's trembling has finished, Lews Therin is gone and where he stood is now a tall mountain.\nElan Morin appears at the mountain where he promises that it won't end that easily for the Dragon."

              "pov_summary": "A nine year old Egwene al'Vere is filling her bucket with water from the Winespring. Today is the day the sheep are sheared on a field just outside Emond's Field. Her job is to carry water to the men and women at work and she takes it very seriously. While filling the bucket she notices a raven nearby. The raven behaves strangely; it seems to be watching the men. Could this raven be the Dark One's eyes?\nKenley Ahan, a boy two years her senior, tells her she can't play with the children this year. Kenley will be allowed to help the older boys next year and he seems to think that gives him some kind of authority. Egwene gives him the level look she's seen the older girls and women use on the boys and men, but it doesn't seem to work very well. Egwene decides that she needs to work on that.\nMaking her way through the crowd she hands out water to anyone who asks for it. There are only five days a year when so many people gather in Emond's Field. At Shearing, the day the merchants come to buy wool, the day the merchants come to buy tabac, Sunday and Foolday. Egwene tries to avoid her four sisters in the crowd. They all seem to think she is a baby and usually treat her accordingly. She also tries to keep away from the big sheepdogs. Not that they would harm her but she doesn't really care for them anyway.\nOn her way back to refill her bucket, she passes the row of trestle tables. She spots Kenley again trying to steal a honey cake from one of the tables. He doesn't get far though, Corin Ayellin catches him quickly. Whatever authority he thought he had over Egwene is now gone.\nAs she moves away from the tables she spots the village smith Master Luhhan talking to Joslyn and Con Aybara. Their son Perrin is with them, looking shy and blushing. She doesn't quite understand what they were discussing but it involved Perrin. She notices she is not the only one watching Perrin. Cilia Cole, a girl a few years older than Egwene is looking at him too. Egwene grimaces at the sight of Cilia making big eyes at Perrin. Then she spots the raven behind Cilia. And it is not the only one, they seem to be everywhere today...\nPerrin's sister Adora asks her why she is staring at Perrin. Egwene is startled by her and she doesn't like the way Adora suggests that she was looking at Perrin in that way. She makes a nasty comment and looks for Perrin again to follow him. Unfortunately he's gone. There is nothing to it but go back to the river to refill her bucket.\nWhen she has refilled the bucket she comes across Mistress Barran, the village Wisdom, with her apprentice, the recently orphaned Nynaeve al'Meara. They are tending a wound Bili Congar inflicted on himself with a pair of wool shears. Behind them Egwene sees dozens and dozens of ravens. None of them are trying to take any food, they are just watching. It looks unnatural to Egwene. Before she can ask the Wisdom about it though, Nynaeve asks her if she doesn't have work to do. Nynaeve is with her back to Egwene, yet she always seems to know when she is there. The only thing she can do is get back to work. Her day doesn't get any better when she overhears her sister Elisa and some other women talking about why her hair isn't braided yet. Elisa takes her frustration out on Egwene.\nAfter she has refilled the bucket again she starts looking for Perrin or Mat. It takes her a while to find the boys. When she finds them, Egwene sneaks up to overhear their conversation. Mat and Perrin are in the company of a few other boys, Rand al'Thor among them. Rand is the boy everybody says she will marry later. Egwene wonders if he will make a good husband, and what, for that matter, a good husband is.\nThe boys talk about their future; most of them expect to follow in their father's footsteps. A few of them dream of seeing something of the world first though. Egwene vows that she will see some of the lands Jain Farstrider describes in her favourite book. Not a lot of people leave the Two Rivers but she would. The boys get ready to get back to work again so it is time for Egwene to leave. When she is about to leave Dannil Lewin passes her hiding place and tells the boys the Mayor wants them. She decides to follow them to see why her father wants to talk to them.\nThe Mayor tells the boys they have worked hard today and that he will reward them with a story. Of course the boys want a story about Trollocs and false Dragons. Bran al'Vere doesn't know any stories about that so he asks Tam al'Thor to do the story telling. Tam decides to tell them the story about how the real Dragon led the Hundred Companions to Shayol Ghul to sealed the bore into the Dark One's prison. Cenn Buie, the thatcher, says that isn't a story decent folk should listen to but all the other men seem to approve so Tam tells it anyway. When Tam is done telling Perrin wants to know what a dragon is in the first place. Tam doesn't know the answer to that.\nThe boys get sent back to work after Tam is done telling his tale. Egwene gets ready to follow them but she suddenly becomes aware of someone watching her. Again she notices the ravens. This time they are not only looking at the boys and men. One of them is looking at her. Determined not to be distracted by silly thoughts Egwene gets on with trying to be the best water carrier ever.\nEgwene had to carry water again next year to her disappointment but the year after she got to help with the food. She set herself a new goal then. To be the youngest girl to get her hair braided ever. It wouldn't be easy but easy goals are not really goals at all. She didn't listen to any more stories though, but she still liked to read of distant lands."

As they walk, Rand gets a feeling that he's being watched and tries to shrug it off. But as the feeling grows stronger, he looks over his shoulder, and sees a black-clad, cloaked figure on a black horse.\nThe rider is totally covered in his cloak so that no part of him is showing. When he looks at him, Rand feels that the rider hates everything that's alive, but him above all things. He stumbles, and Tam asks him what's wrong, but when they look down the road again, it is empty. Tam reminds him of the flame and the void, a thing he has taught Rand. He should concentrate on one flame and feed all of his passions in it until his mind became empty, and focus on the void.\nThey finally arrive in Emond's Field, where things are being done ready for Bel Tine. Wit Congar stops them and asks Tam what to do with the village's Wisdom, Nynaeve al'Meara. The Congars and Coplins are well known for being complainers and troublemakers. He is stopped by his wife, Daise Congar, who tells him not to meddle in Women's Circle business. As they continue, they walk past the Green, where older women are erecting the Spring Pole.

Fain says that they cannot be sure whether he is the Dragon Reborn or just a false Dragon, but that this one can channel the One Power and that a party of Aes Sedai has ridden south from Tar Valon to deal with him.\nThe Village Council brings the peddler to the inn to discuss the issue more thoroughly. Mat, Perrin and Rand start discussing the news and tales about the Dragon and Aes Sedai. Mat has just told the others that Bili Congar named the Dark One last year when Nynaeve comes to them and tells Mat that he \"shouldn't be off his mother's apron strings\". Rand suddenly notices Egwene standing behind the Wisdom watching them. He tells Nynaeve what the peddler said, and she quickly leaves to get the Woman's Circle to \"find out anything useful\".\nEgwene starts talking to Rand and tells him that she wants to become a Wisdom. Rand is disapproving about it, but suddenly Mat says that Perrin got a coin from Moiraine too, and that he saw the rider too.\nPerrin says that Master Luhhan didn't quite believe him, but he carried his biggest hammer with him that day. When Egwene asks what they talk about, Mat and Perrin start talking about their encounters with the black-cloaked rider. Egwene thinks it's silly that they shall go around and spread tales scaring children. She is about to say something when the door to the inn opens and the gleeman comes out."

When he finds out that the Wisdom and the Village Council are discussing the news about the war in Ghealdan, he calls it old news, even for Baerlon.\nThom Merrilin then asks Egwene if she would be his assistant at his performance, something she accepts. The gleeman smirks when Perrin and Mat tell him that they've been to Watch Hill, Deven Ride, the Mire and the Mountains of Mist, but apologizes as his tongue \"has always gotten him in bad trouble\".\nWhen he sees that a small crowd has gathered around them, he starts juggling balls and talks about the stories he will tell them.\nHe suddenly stops talking and juggling when Moiraine shows up and asks her who she is and what she's doing here and when she has answered and left with Lan, he's obviously not pleased. As the Village Council exits the inn, he goes to get some strong brandy, to the disappointment of the spectators.\nBran al'Vere argues with both Nynaeve and Cenn Buie before the Village Council spreads and moves off in different directions. Rand and his friends go to talk with Tam, who tells them that there shouldn't be anything to worry about, but that they'll organize a watch to patrol around in Deven Ride, Watch Hill and Taren Ferry.\nHe then tells Rand that they should get going and meet in the stables in five minutes.\nRand, Mat and Perrin decide to join the watch and tell the Mayor about the rider. However, they think that they should try to find more people who have seen him, and decide that Mat and Perrin should\u200b ask more people whether they've spotted the rider that evening.\nRand then sets off to the stables so Tam won't have to worry about him.\nThey walk in silence for a while before Rand asks why the Council needed to question the peddler. Tam tells him that if they had taken the decision straight away, people could get worried about Aes Sedai and alike, and tomorrow morning \"half the village would have been sure the whole war was to descend on us\". They then discuss who and what the rider is, and Tam says that two of the Village Council member's sons had seen him too, something that made Rand feel more secure and as \"there was nothing the black-cloaked horseman could do that the people of Emond's Field could not handle together\"."

Finding nothing, they go about their chores and settle down for supper.\nTam pulls out a sword from an old chest and tells Rand he had gotten it a long time ago and that it was not worth much, that he had paid too much for it and Rand's mother did not approve. Tam tells Rand he had thought of giving it away and that it is not much use for herding sheep, plowing a field or harvesting a crop. Tam wants to have the sword should their luck change though. The sword looks much like Lan's sword, except that Tam's is decorated with herons. The only people Rand had ever seen with swords before were merchant's guards and Lan, so it was quite a surprise to him.\nWhile they're about to settle down to supper, Trollocs burst through the front door. Tam begins fighting off the beasts with his sword and yells to Rand to escape out the back.\nSlipping out a window while more Trollocs break down the back door, Rand escapes to the barn while Tam jumps out a window and leads the monsters away from his son.\nRand then sneak into the woods where he and Tam are reunited, however Tam is injured and burning up with a fever. Tam explains the little bit he knows of Trollocs, that they can see better than a man in the dark, but bright lights blind them for a short time. That some can track by scent or sound and that they are lazy, that they'll give up after a while. Tam tells Rand that Trollocs kill for the pleasure of killing and that they cannot be trusted unless they are afraid of you, and not even much then.\nRand needs to get Tam to Nynaeve in Emond's Field if he wants to help his father's fever. Taking Tam's sword and returning to the farmhouse, Rand plans to gather blankets, clothes, a cart and Bela.\nRand finds one Trolloc by the name of Narg still alive in the house. Rand is frightened and holds up the sword in defense, Narg asks him repeatedly to lower the sword, that he only wants to talk, and that the Myrddraal wants to talk to him. After a little while Rand lowers his sword only to have the Trolloc lunge at him, Rand brings the blade up and manages to kill it in defense.\nGathering what he needs from the house and going to the barn Rand discovers Bela gone and the cart broken. Rand uses the sword to cut shafts from the cart so he can carry Tam, he's surprised that the sword is still razor sharp afterwards and testing the blade with his finger cuts himself.\nRand then returns to the woods and begins tending to Tam's wound."

Tam says, \"They came over the Dragonwall like a flood and washed the land with blood. How many died for Laman's sin?\" Rand thinks Tam is speaking of Trollocs flooding the land and tells his father there aren't any around right now. He offers his father some water which Tam pushes away with a strong arm.\nTam grabs Rand's collar and pulls him close speaking urgently, \"They called them savages. The fools said they could be swept aside like rubbish. How many battles lost, how many cities burned, before they faced the truth?\"\nWhen Tam goes on telling how they fought all the way to the Shining Walls, Rand stops his father and claps a hand over Tam's muttering as the black cloaked rider, followed by a group of Trollocs, pass by on the road. The black cloaked rider passes back by once again, alone this time, searching from side to side every few steps. The black cloaked rider moves past Rand and his father, then rushes back in its original direction.\nOnce gone, Rand begins carrying the litter again and Tam continues his fever dreams, speaking about Avendesora, the tree of life. Rand begins wondering if all the stories he knows are real.\nTam speaks a broken up tale in his fever dream, \"..battles are always hot, even in the snow. Sweat heat. Blood heat. Only death is cool. Slope of the mountain... only place didn't stink of death. Had to get away from the smell of it... sight of it. ...heard a baby cry. Their women fight alongside the men, sometimes, but why had they let her come, I don't... gave birth there alone, before she died of her wounds... covered her child with her cloak, but the wind... blown the cloak away... child blue with the cold. Should have been dead, too... crying there. Crying in the snow. I couldn't just leave the child... no children of our own... always knew you wanted children. I knew you'd take it to your heart, Kari. Yes, lass. Rand is a good name. A good name.\"\nRand is shocked at Tam's words and stumbles to his knees.

Egwene, running around trying to help others, leads Rand and Master Luhhan to Nynaeve.\nMaster Luhhan speaks a bit of the night while they wait for Egwene to get Nynaeve. He tells Rand that Mat's alive and that they will pick up the pieces and build again and that the Light will take care of them and if it doesn't they will take care of themselves. Then Master Luhhan leaves Rand to wait for Nynaeve, saying he has things to do.\nNynaeve looks Tam over but says she can do nothing for him. Nynaeve knows what her medicines can do and also knows when it's too late to help someone. Rand protests, but Nynaeve tells him she has to help those she knows she can help. Rand's hope crumbles and he feels empty. Thinking the Mayor will know what to do, Rand heads to the Winespring Inn.\nThom is outside the inn and helps Rand carry Tam inside. The Mayor is surprised to see the al'Thors alive and helps Rand get Tam to a bed.\nHe speaks to Rand of the night and how Moiraine called a ball of lightning down from the sky and Lan was a whirlwind with his sword, that he was a weapon himself, seeming to be in ten places at once fighting the Trollocs.\nAfter a little prompting from Thom, the Mayor suddenly realizes there is a way to help Tam. Mayor al'Vere tells Rand how Aes Sedai can Heal, and though nobody ever wants to get involved with Aes Sedai, its the only chance he can see to help Tam. Rand is willing to do anything, even deal with the Aes Sedai, to save Tam.\nRand goes and finds Moiraine and Lan who are searching the dead Trollocs. The Aes Sedai and her Warder discover Trollocs are working together in a way not seen since the Trolloc Wars. Moiraine says she fears they are further behind than ever.\nMoiraine murmurs that there is 'A little more light in the darkness' when she sees Rand and asks him how his dreams are.

Master al'Vere mentions that Thom was there and didn't get his cloak singed sitting in front of the fireplace.\nRand doesn't care what the gleeman did and pleads to stay near his father when Moiraine tells everyone to leave. Moiraine impatiently agrees to let Rand remain and says he may talk, but to do so quietly.\nMoiraine begins using the One Power to ease Tam's breathing while Lan and Rand speak in quiet tones. Lan remarks about the sword Rand is carrying, saying how strange it is to see a sheepherder with one. He asks Rand if it by chance has any herons on it, to which Rand replies it does, however Rand is more concerned with what Moiraine is doing. Lan comments that he didn't think to find a heron-mark sword in a place like the Two Rivers and Rand tells him it's Tam's sword, that he'd bought it a long time ago.\nRand watches Moiraine and Tam while talking quietly with the Warder, he says Tam never had any use for the sword, until last night. Lan goes on to tell Rand that in some lands the heron is the symbol of a master swordsman and Tam must not always have thought it was useless.\nRand asks about the night before, about what the mayor told him they (Moiraine and Lan) had done. He asks the Warder if they could have done something differently if they had known about the black cloaked rider sooner. Moiraine jumps into the conversation saying even then they couldn't have done much more without half a dozen of her sisters. She says that by herself, a month's warning wouldn't have made much difference, that there was an entire fist of Trollocs, well over one hundred around the district and that one person can only do so much, even with the One Power.\nMoiraine says that she'll not have Rand thinking he is to blame, that the raven they saw the day before should've warned her, but she was too overconfident. Rand is confused about the raven and Lan explains that they are often used as spies for the Dark One as are rats and crows.\nMoiraine then explains that Tam's wound came from a tainted blade forged in the valley of Thakan'dar on the slopes of Shayol Ghul. The wound will not heal unaided and if left alone will grow again and consume Tam.\nMoiraine uses an angreal carved out of ivory and in the shape of a woman in flowing robes to aid in Healing Tam. Once Moiraine finishes Healing Tam, she joins Lan and Rand's talk. They explain to Rand about the attack and tell him he has to leave the Two Rivers if he wants to protect it.\nThe Trollocs had a purpose in their attack, to kill or capture young men Rand's age, which includes Perrin and Mat. The Myrddraal was after them and nobody else. Rand doesn't understand why and Moiraine tells him his answers cannot be found in The Two Rivers and that there is something about one or all of them that the Dark One fears. Rand can't believe what he's hearing. They tell him the Myrddraal and Trollocs will be back and Rand begins to understand why he has to leave. Moiraine tells Rand that Tar Valon is a place of safety and he can find the answers to his questions there.\nMoiraine and Lan plan to leave after full dark and in secret. The Aes Sedai and Warder then depart to find Perrin and Mat.\nThe Mayor and his wife return with food for Rand and suggest he get some sleep.

Mayor al'Vere and Master Luhhan come to break up the crowd.\nMoiraine, angered by the crowd, tells them their history, that of Manetheren. She tells them of King Aemon and Queen Eldrene, 'bravery, beauty, wisdom and love that death could not sunder.' The Red Eagle banner of Manetheren was at the head of every battle that raged during the Trolloc Wars.\nA Trolloc army moved against the home of Manetheren while its soldiers were away on the Field of Bekkar. The men of Manetheren marched home as if their feet had wings and when the armies of the Dark One reached their lands, the men of Manetheren were waiting for them.\nAemon sent word for help and was promised aid if they could hold three days. The men of Manetheren held back the Trolloc hoards for ten days, aid never came and they could no longer hold back the Dark One's armies. Aemon then sent word throughout his land for his people to flee and find safety.\nIt first came in a trickle then a river and a flood, the people of Manetheren did not flee, rather came to defend their home.\nThe time came when the people of Manetheren were surrounded in what would one day become Emond's Field, no man or woman who stood beneath the Red Eagle banner that day lived to see the night. Manetheren, called 'The sword that could not be broken' was shattered.\nEldrene, alone in the city of Manetheren, felt her husband Aemon die and was filled with vengeance for her love, her people and her land. In her grief Eldrene drew on the True Source and hurled the One Power at the army of Trollocs. The Dreadlords died wherever they were and the Dark One's victorious army fled.\nThe Trollocs were hunted down by other armies in other lands, none of those who murdered the people of Manetheren at Aemon's Field lived.\nDrawing on too much of the One Power, Eldrene died as the Dreadlords did, she and Manetheren were both consumed by fire. The people paid for their land with blood and were bound to it.\nAfter Moiraine's tale, the crowd is ashamed of their actions and breaks up. Lan tells Rand and Mat that it's time to go."

She had spotted Mat and Perrin sneaking around like \"bull calves pretending to be foxes\" and when she put that together with Lan buying more horses, she could only see one answer. When the boys try to get her to change her mind and remind her about the trollocs, she asks them to spare her those \"nonsensical tales\".

Lan tells them that it's a Draghkar, and Moiraine says that if the Trollocs have a Draghkar at their command they will soon know where they are.\nThe villagers asks what a Draghkar is, and Thom explains that \"in the war that ended the Age of Legends, worse than Trollocs and Halfmen were created\".

These actions seem to make Master Hightower nervous, and he quickly points out that the gold he got is now safely hidden.\nThey then enter the ferry, \"a wooden barge with high sides, boarded by a ramp,\" and as soon as they've gathered in the center of the ferry, they start crossing the River Taren.\nWhen Rand quietly asks Lan whether they would've tried to rob them, the Warder replies \"when what they do is hidden, men sometimes deal with strangers in ways they wouldn't if there were other eyes to see.\"\nAfter a journey in silence, they arrive on the other side, where Master Hightower gets his gold, and the haulers a silver mark each for \"the quick crossing\". As he eyes Lan's purse greedily, the ferry suddenly gets loose with a loud creak. It's taken in a whirlpool, and Lan gives Master Hightower some more gold, before he and his haulers start trotting up the riverside.\nWhen Thom asks why Moiraine doesn't cover them with fog on this side of the river as the Draghkar can easily see them where they are, she tells him that Draghkar are not very smart, and that the Myrddraal probably will have to divide his efforts to find them. Mat asks awkwardly about the ferry, and she explains that she intends\u200b to get them safely to Tar Valon.\nThey then walk up the riverbank and into the woods where they stop at a dried-up watercourse, hidden under a heap of trees. Lan tells them that he expected them to stop there, as it \"seemed a likely place\". He then goes to check the horses.\nMoiraine asks Egwene if they can talk, and they crawl into a pile of tree trunks to talk for themselves.\nLan hands the others feedbags and some oats for the horses. When Perrin remarks that it doesn't look like they need any rest, the Warder tells them that they can run at their fastest until the second they drop dead by exhaustion they never even felt.\nThey can hear the Draghkar's shrieks, but according to Lan, it's just searching the river for them.\nThe rest of the party then crawls into the opening Egwene and Moiraine had gone into, where they find a cave with a roof of tree trunks and branches. Moiraine and Egwene sit on the other side of a fire, Moiraine talking about the One Power. She tells Egwene that she is one of the handful who don't have to learn to use the One Power as she is born with it, and will eventually start to channel.\nShe holds up a blue stone and guides Egwene in her first attempt to channel light into it, and she manages to produce a small flicker all by her own. Moiraine tells her that she has accomplished something most women who come to the Tower take months to learn, and that she one day even may become the Amyrlin Seat. She cries out in delight and tells Rand that she will be an Aes Sedai."

Rand, Mat and Perrin all thinking they'll only be gone from the Two Rivers a short time.\nLan scouts ahead and behind the party, searching for ambush or pursuit. Lan also spends time teaching Rand, Mat and Perrin how to use their weapons. Each of the boys do quite well with a bow, and then Lan teaches Rand how to use his sword and Perrin his axe.\nRand watches Egwene unbraid her hair one morning and asks her why she did that. Egwene tells him that she'll be Aes Sedai and that they don't braid their hair unless they want to. Rand and Egwene argue for a bit until Lan speaks up reminding them they need to be quiet.\nMat begins thinking that they've lost the Trollocs for good and wants to explore the world. Moiraine and Egwene return from one of their talks just then and Moiraine asks if they've already forgotten Winternight. She tells them again that the Dark One is after one or all of them and that she will destroy them herself before she allows the Dark One to have them.\nRand is bothered by Moiraine and Egwene going off to speak alone each night, so after everyone else settles down one night, he sneaks off to find out what they're doing. They speak a bit of the Five Powers. Egwene wants to be reassured that female Aes Sedai are not evil, that it was the men who broke the world. Moiraine tells her that the men who broke the world were not evil, they were insane. Moiraine also tells her that Aes Sedai are still human, that in Tar Valon, she'll meet both kind and cruel Aes Sedai, brave and cowardly, strong and weak. Egwene asks why the Trollocs came to Emond's Field and Moiraine swings her head to the tree Rand is hiding behind. Rand backs away into the shadows and scurries away as quietly as he can.\nThey travel on and atop a low hill spot Baerlon. Moiraine tells them they must be careful what they say and they must attract as little attention as possible. She also says that her and Lan go by different names here. She is known as Alys and Lan is known as Andra.\nLan leads them down the hill and through some woods to heavy wooden gates. The gatekeeper nearly tells them to try another gate until he sees Moiraine. The gatekeeper, Avin, says he didn't know it was them and opens the gate.\nMoiraine and Lan speak with Avin, he tells them that Whitecloaks are in the city and though they haven't caused much trouble, nobody wants them there. He also mentions a man in Ghealdan claiming to be The Dragon with an army moving towards Tear and that Aes Sedai were sent to Ghealdan, though some or all are said to be dead.\nMoiraine leads them off and Rand asks Thom about the rumors Avin spoke of. Thom tells Rand a bit of the Karaethon Cycle. Of the Stone of Tear, and if it falls it'll be one of the major proofs that the Dragon is reborn. The prophecies don't make much sense to Rand and Thom tells him that they wouldn't be much for prophecies if they were easy to fulfill.\nThey arrive at the Stag and Lion through a back gate into the stables. The innkeeper, Master Fitch welcomes them and leads everyone inside telling them of the best hot meals and warm beds in Baerlon and the hottest, best baths too."

Moiraine asks about the Children of the Light being in town and Fitch says not to worry, they're up to tricks claiming there are Aes Sedai in Baerlon. A servant named Ara arrives to lead Rand, Mat, Perrin and Thom away to hot baths while another leads Moiraine and Egwene away.\nIn the bath chamber, Ara makes a few comments about Ghealdan trouble and Trollocs in Saldaea. Mat nearly tells him about Trollocs in the Two Rivers except for Rand, Perrin and Thom putting in words just in time to stop him. Lan shows up in the baths, sends Ara away and lectures the boys again about what they say.\nAfter the baths, Rand spots a girl in mens clothing and short hair with Moiraine. She looks at them sharply, nods to Moiraine and then hurries away.\nThey then settle down for some dinner in a private dinning room. They listen to Lan speak of the rumors people are saying around town. Of the false Dragon Logain being the victor in Ghealdan. He says there are no strangers that could be Myrddraal and certainly no Trollocs. Also that Whitecloaks are in town and trying to make things difficult for the Governor. Moiraine suggests that they remain in Baerlon a couple days and Lan agrees so long as they remember what he told them.\nReturning to his room, Rand drifts to sleep. Rand finds himself in a shadowy stone hallway with doors spaced at regular intervals. He walks down the unchanging hallway for a long time before opening one of the doors into a grim, stone walled chamber. Rand finds a man in dark clothing with a mouth and eyes of flame. Rand hurls himself out of the room, across the hallway and into another room, identical to the first with the same man there waiting for him, Ba'alzamon.\nBa'alzamon asks Rand if he was told that the Eye of the World would serve him. He also says that the Amyrlin Seat will use him until there is nothing left of him.\nRand is frightened and tells Ba'alzamon that he is bound in Shayol Ghul. Ba'alzamon says that he has never been bound, that he was with Lews Therin Kinslayer when he killed everyone he cared for. And that he whispered in Artur Hawkwing's ear and Aes Sedai died. He whispered again and the High King sent his armies across the Aryth Ocean dooming his dream of one land and one king. Ba'alzamon says that if he could control those men, what chance does Rand have.\nRand insists that he is dreaming. Ba'alzamon curves his finger and breaks a rat's back then tries to break Rand's back to prove to him he is not dreaming.\nRand awakes and finds Lan and Thom asleep. Rand wonders if Moiraine can help with the dreams and if he can trust her. Slowly sleep comes back over him."

He notices that Lan's sword is gone and decides to follow the Warder's example and take his own sword.\nRand goes downstairs to find Master Fitch and Sara (the inn's cook) in an argument about Sara's cat and dead rats being found around the inn. After Fitch leaves, Sara has one of the servants bring Rand some food and she tells him that his friends have all gone out into the city, except one who wasn't feeling well. She makes a comment about the rats being found and their backs being broken. Rand's food loses all taste, and he feels that he has to talk to someone.\nRand finds Perrin in his room and Perrin tells him he isn't feeling well after some bad dreams and not sleeping through the night. They discover they had the same dream or close enough anyway and wonder if Mat too had a similar dream.\nRand wants to go out into the city but Perrin says he doesn't and that he'll catch up later. Rand goes outside to see more people than he'd ever seen before. He doesn't feel good about leaving Perrin behind and thinks that Thom may finish his performance, then he could talk with him so Rand sits down on a barrel in the back of the inn to wait a little while.\nRand meets Min while waiting and she tells him about seeing things about people and the Pattern. She says that they are all tied together in the Pattern. When Rand asks about Egwene, Min tells him she is tied in too and that while they both love each other, they are not for one another the way they both want. She mentions a few images she sees around Lan, Thom, Perrin and Mat. Rand then asks about himself and she replies with a list of things, then says that she sees three women standing over a funeral bier with him on it and black rock wet with blood. Rand breaks in and says that's enough.\nRand quickly leaves Min and moves into the crowed street. He wanders through the crowd taking in the city until he spots Padan Fain. Fain darts away into an alley and Rand follows after him.\nFain is acting oddly and talks about running since Winternight. Rand tells him that they thought he was dead, that they are staying at the Stag and Lion and that he should come back with him. Rand thinks Moiraine will help him out but Fain doesn't want her help and asks Rand to promise not to tell her that he'd seem him alive. Rand promises and Fain dashes away and around a corner.\nRand chases after Fain and crashes into Mat. Mat and Rand share a few words about seeing Fain and then about their dreams.\nRand and Mat start heading back to the inn when they see three Whitecloaks. Mat thinks that they are full of themselves and slips away and up onto a rooftop. Using his sling, Mat breaks a stake holding back a dozen barrels causing them to roll away and splash mud on the Whitecloaks.\nRand laughs and soon finds himself face to face with the Children of the Light. They see Rand's sword and ask him questions. Rand avoids answering them and one of them, Bornhald, asks him what evil is in him that he refuses to answer.\nIn the middle of the Whitecloaks' threats the City Watch appears up the street. Bornhald calls out that Baerlon stands in the Shadow of the Dark One. He then tells Rand that Darkfriends do not escape them.\nThe Whitecloaks move on and Mat comes out of hiding in a shop. Mat tells Rand he's crazy and they start back to the inn meeting Thom on the way. Mat begins to tell Thom about the dream and when Rand mentions Ba'alzamon, Thom hurries them into an alley warning them never to speak that name where someone could hear.\nAfter they tell Thom about the men the Dark One mentioned in their dream, Thom tells them to keep their dream quiet for now and wonders if Perrin has the sense to. They hurry back to the inn and Perrin is just running out as they arrive. Perrin says he didn't tell anyone about the dream.\nPerrin then says that he was coming to look for them and tell them that Nynaeve came after them and is inside the inn."

Thom hurries Rand on but Min replies to the bard that he should go juggle something. Rand protests but Min quiets him. She tells him that a young woman with dark eyes and dark, braided hair arrived at the inn a while ago. Min saw a lot of sparks around her, just as she had with Rand and the others. Rand understands that it's Nynaeve, but tells Min that she won't harm them.\nHe meets up with the others and tells them that Nynaeve is 'a part of it'. They ask what she's part of and if Min knows something, but Mat says grumpily that she's a part of the same bad luck they've had since Winternight. Rand quickly tells them that she saw Nynaeve arrive and talk to Mistress Alys and thought she might have something to do with them, something his friends accepts. Rand dislikes keeping things secret from his friends, but thinks that Min's secret can be dangerous for her, so he holds his tongue.\nWhen the party enter the room they'd eaten in the night before, Moiraine, Nynaeve and Egwene are seated and Lan is leaning against the mantel.\nThe rest of the men sit down and Lan offers Nynaeve a cup of wine as he asks her how she found them. When she tells him that she followed their trail, Lan looks surprised and remarks that he must be getting careless. She says that her father often took her hunting with him and taught her what he would have taught the sons he never had.\nWhen Nynaeve asks why she should help hide them, Thom tells her that there are people in Baerlon that would kill Moiraine for what she is, and Lan too. And since the rest are all associated with them, it's enough facts for the Whitecloaks. He says that the Whitecloak Questioners assume that you're guilty even before they start the interrogation and don't care about finding the truth.\nRand says that they must go on to Tar Valon when the Aes Sedai and the Wisdom start discussing what is safest for them. At last Moiraine tells Egwene and the others to leave her and Nynaeve alone and everybody but the two women leaves the room.\nRand starts wondering how Nynaeve can be a part of it and how any of them can be involved with Trollocs and Fades at all. The villagers stand outside the door with Lan for a while before Nynaeve walks out. When she looks at Rand, he realizes that the others had quietly left him alone with the Wisdom. When Rand asks her whether she's going to join them, she tells him that Mavra Mallen came from Deven Ride to see to things and that she'll want to return as soon as she can.\nShe tells him that the village meeting had been a shambles and that while everybody agreed that somebody should be sent for them, it didn't seem that they would come to an agreement on who should be sent. Nynaeve called the Woman's Circle together and told them what needed to be done, and while they didn't like it, they saw the right of it, and therefore she came.\nWhen Rand asks her about what Moiraine had told her, she says that she asked some questions about the boys and when Rand tells him that Tam had said he wasn't his son, she tells him that people say weird things in a fever, things that are not true.\nFurther on, she says that when Tam returned to Emond's Field, he brought a red-haired outlander wife and a babe. Kari al'Thor took care of that babe with as much love and delight as any other woman with a babe.\nRand then asks her what she's going to do and she tells him that they will have to see."

When he enters the crowded room he sees that Thom is performing The Great Hunt of the Horn and he makes his way and sits down next to Perrin and Mat.\nThe gleeman performs 'The Bargain of Rogosh Eagle-eye', 'Lian's Stand', 'The Fall of Aleth-Loriel', 'Gaidal Cain's Sword' and 'The Last Ride of Buad of Albhain'. Finally he exchanges his harp with his flute and two men join him with a drum and a hammered dulcimer.\nThey clear the room for dancing and when Rand dances, he finds himself staring at a man with a scar crossing his whole face. He quickly looks away and wonders if he has insulted the man. Rand then dances with Nynaeve, Moiraine and Egwene before sitting down on the bench.\nToward midnight Moiraine and Egwene leave, and after one dance Nynaeve follows them. Lan walks up to Mat, Perrin and Rand and tells them that they should get to bed since they need to make an early start. Mat tells the Warder that a scarred man has been staring at him and Rand says that he stared at him too. Lan says that according to Master Fitch he's a spy for the Whitecloaks, but no worry for them.\nThe others go to their rooms but Rand decides to get some milk. He hurries to the kitchen and when he come out, a Fade walks toward him from the shadows and tells him that he is one of them. Rand wants to run but he cannot break free from the eye-less gaze. The Myrddraal says that Rand belongs to the Great Lord of the Dark before it darts down the hall and loses itself in the shadows. Lan leaps down the stairs, sword in hand, when Rand tells him what has happened. He says that they are leaving. The others join them and they walk to the stables to get their horses.\nThey ride down the streets of Baerlon alone, and when they reach the Caemlyn Gate, Lan wakes a Watchman and makes him open the gates. Five Whitecloaks appear and asks them who they are and why they want to leave at night. They tell them that a Draghkar has been seen flying over the town.\nOne of the Whitecloaks, Bornhald, recognizes Rand and tells the Watchmen that Rand's party are Darkfriends and that they will take them to their camp. Moiraine then starts talking, her voice coming from every direction. She seems to grow taller and Bornhald shouts 'Aes Sedai' while unsheathing his sword to attack Moiraine. She blocks his attack with her staff causing the Whitecloak to hurl back into his companions, sending them all down in a heap.\nLan commands the others through the gate and when Rand turns, he sees that Moiraine's head and shoulders are above the wall. They stop about fifty paces from the wall and watch the Aes Sedai step over the wall. When her feet are on the ground outside, she's suddenly back to her normal size again.\nEven though Bornhald commands the Watchmen to hold the gates, they close and seal them. When Moiraine catches up with them, Egwene looks at her in awe and says how she was taller than a giant. She responds by saying that the mind plays tricks at night and the eye sees what is not there.\nThey move down the Caemlyn Road at an easy pace. After an hour, they see flames over Baerlon and Moiraine tells them that it's the inn. Nynaeve gets angry and asks her how she can say it so easily and why she doesn't help. The Aes Sedai tells her that she will send Master Fitch gold enough to rebuild the Stag and Lion. They continue their trip down the road till they make camp. Lan gives them one hour to sleep on.\nMat, Perrin and Rand whisper about whether they will be safe in Tar Valon before they fall asleep at last.\nLan wakes them just before dawn, and once they have rolled the blankets together and strapped them behind their saddles, they start riding again. At sunrise they eat breakfast in their saddles, all bleary-eyed and huddling in their cloaks except Lan. The Warder's eyes are searching constantly as if he expects an ambush at any moment."

              "pov_summary": "Three days after leaving Baerlon, the party stops at the top of a hill. Lan is studying the road ahead and behind while the others sit under some trees eating. Egwene talks about how good some tea would've been and Nynaeve tells her that flatwort tea and andilay root are best for fatigue. The Warder tells them that they have a Fade or two and their Trollocs on their tail who know what road they're taking. Thom asks what stops them from having someone or something at Whitebridge already when a horn sounds from the west. The Warder tells him that nothing stops them and that they must trust the Light, but now they know for certain that there are Trollocs behind them.\nThey mount their horses when a second horn blows and this time another answers. Lan tells Moiraine to keep them moving and sets off heading west. Moiraine responds \"The Light go with you, last Lord of Seven Towers\", before she moves on with the others at a steady trot. Rand wonders what last Lord of Seven Towers means, when the horns sound again, closer this time, maybe seven or eight miles behind.\nWhen Nynaeve urges them to go faster, the Aes Sedai tells her that that may be what they are wishing for, and keeps the same steady pace.\nEvery time the horns sound, it sounds closer. When Rand thinks they are about five miles away, Lan comes galloping over the hill behind them and tells Moiraine that there are at least three fists of Trollocs, maybe five, each led by a Halfman. He says that they are closing the gap and will be on them in an hour or less. Suddenly a horn sounds in the west, behind them and is answered from one ahead of them.\nThe Aes Sedai says that they can go south or north, when Lan says that there is a place the Trollocs won't go. Moiraine says no, but after some discussion, they decide to go north.\nThey ride through the woods and hear the horns directly behind them. They top a hill and below them they meet an army of Trollocs led by a Myrddraal. The Fade unsheathes its sword and rides at Lan, followed by the Trollocs. The Warder cries to the rest to stay with him before he sets down the hill, shouting \"for the Seven Towers\". The rest of the group streams after Lan, and caught up by Lan's cry, Rand shouts \"Manetheren! Manetheren!\", repeated by Perrin. Mat shouts \"Carai an Caldazar! Carai an Ellisande! Al Ellisande!\"\nThe Warder and Myrddraal fight alone in a clear circle while Rand rides about, swinging his sword with the little skill Lan has taught him. Nynaeve and Egwene are close to Moiraine who lashes out with her staff, causing fire to envelop Trollocs. Rand is surrounded by Trollocs who try to unhorse him when suddenly all of them fall on the ground shouting. He then sees the Myrddraal sitting in its saddle without a head. Thom yells that it won't die until nightfall while Lan urges them on. They can hear the horns from west, east and south.\nRand turns and sees that only a hundred spans is separating the Trollocs and his party. Moiraine climbs down from Aldieb's back and takes out the angreal. With the angreal in one hand and the staff in the other she faces the Trollocs and the three Fades. She raises her staff and stabs it down in the earth, causing the ground to tremble and ripple. The Trollocs begin to tumble down the slope in heaps yet the Myrddraal moves forward in a line, their horses never missing a step. The Aes Sedai then lifts her staff and the earth stills. She points to the hollow between the hills and flames spread as far as the eye can see, creating a wall between the Trollocs and the humans. Lan then makes them go on while he takes care of Moiraine who nearly falls on the ground.\nThey soon catch up with the others and Moiraine tells them that she will be all right soon and that she's not at her strongest while working with Earth and Fire. After some riding, Lan stops and talks alone with Moiraine. Egwene asks Rand about the things he shouted at the Trollocs and he says that they had to shout something, as that's what you do in times like that. Perrin adds that they had a right since Moiraine said they all were descended from Manetheren. Egwene says that it wasn't that she meant, but what Mat was shouting. He tells her that he can't remember where it came from or what it meant, and Egwene says that for a moment she thought she understood him, though it's gone now. Moiraine comes up to them and says that it means 'for the honor of the Red Eagle. For the honor of the Rose of the Sun. The Rose of the Sun'; the ancient warcry of Manetheren and the warcry of its last king. She says that the blood of Arad's lines is strong in the Two Rivers and that the old blood still sings.\nHorns start blowing again, and Lan says the Trollocs have passed the fire and that Moiraine is not strong enough for what she intends and that she needs rest. And neither Myrddraal nor Trolloc will enter that place. Moiraine sighs, but agrees, and gets the others to gather close around her. She stands in her stirrups and starts swinging the staff over their heads, before thrusting it out to the west. She tells them it's for the Trollocs, that their scents and tracks will seem to follow it. They set off again, and soon they reach something that Rand believes is a cliff first but when he looks closer he understands that it is a city at least fifty times as big as Baerlon. When Egwene wonders what city it was, Moiraine tells her that it was called Aridhol and it was an ally to Manetheren in the Trolloc Wars. Later, the place died and got another name: Shadar Logoth."

              "pov_summary": "They ride into the city, and although the city was broken, Rand is awed by what's left standing. The largest building in Baerlon would have disappeared in the shadows of almost everything in the city; marble palaces topped with huge domes, bronze fountains, statues and towers. Rand thinks to himself of how Thom, Lan and Moiraine must have laughed up their sleeves at him, thinking Baerlon was a city. He is so caught up in staring at everything that he is taken by surprise when Lan stops them in front of a white stone building, twice as big as the Stag and Lion. Moiraine nods, and Lan commands the 'farm boys' to bring the horses inside.\nThey gather the horses and bring them in where Moiraine is laying. She asks Nynaeve if she has any herbs that will help her sleep an hour and not leave her groggy and the Wisdom tells her about a tea.\nThom, Mat, Perrin and Rand walk into a chamber where they unsaddle their horses. Mat gets a glum stare on his face and Rand asks him what's wrong. He says that he's thinking of Aemon's war cry, and Perrin tells him that maybe he's Aemon reborn when Thom warns him that that is dangerous talk and nothing to be spoken of lightly. The gleeman then goes back to the front room to have a smoke. Mat asks the others why don't they go and see more of the city, but Perrin asks him if he's forgetting the Trollocs. Rand says that Aridhol must have been the greatest city in the Trolloc Wars for the Trollocs to still be afraid of it. They agree at last and walk out on the streets of Aridhol.\nThey wander in and out of the biggest buildings they can find and climb into dusty fountains with huge basins, but find nothing more than dust and rubble. After some time even Mat grows tired and they sit down on the steps of a tall building, arguing about what to do next. Rand wants to go back to sleep, but Mat says that there might be treasure. When Rand tells him that it's getting late, Mat says he wants to climb one of the whole towers. A man's voice then speaks and says that the towers are not safe. They ask him who he is and he introduces himself as Mordeth, a treasure hunter. They tell him that they are going to Caemlyn, and he asks them if they would like to help him carry a treasure he's found to his horses. They accept and he leads them into the building and down some steps before they enter a tile-walled room filled with mounds of jewelry, coins, goblets, platters, swords and gems. They decide to come back tomorrow and explain that Moiraine and Lan will understand when they see an axe Perrin is taking with him. Mordeth asks them if they are alone and Mat answers that they're in the company of Moiraine, Lan, Nynaeve, Egwene and Thom and that they're going to Tar Valon.\nThis causes Mordeth's face to twist in rage and fear and he accuses them of lying to him. Perrin carefully puts the axe back and asks whether they should return tomorrow. When Mordeth is about to answer, Rand figures out what is wrong with Mordeth - he doesn't have a shadow. Mordeth says 'it is decided,' and swells like a balloon. They panic and start yelling then suddenly Mordeth is sitting in the corner of the room clutching his knees to his chest, wailing. He then shouts 'You are all dead!' then disappears.\nThey run up the steps and get out on the streets. From there they keep in the middle of the street and walk fast back to camp. At twilight, they come in sight of the white stone building and they run to it and through the doorway. Everyone except Lan is there. Nynaeve tells them that he is off looking for them. Moiraine asks them what has happened and they start to tell her, all in different places and none in the order it had happened. Moiraine suddenly grabs Rand's wrist at the mention of Mordeth and asks if he gave them anything or touched them. They say no and Mat says that they thought it was safe in the city since Trollocs wouldn't dare coming in. She tells them a story of thousands of Trollocs, Darkfriends, Myrddraal and Dreadlords that had camped in Shadar Logoth late in the Trolloc Wars that never came back out.\nShe then tells them about how the man Mordeth came to Aridhol when it seemed as though the Father of Lies must surely conquer. He spoke to Balwen, the King in Aridhol, and soon he was second only to the King. Aridhol started to draw in on itself, and used the battle cry: 'the victory of the Light is all'. She tells them about how Aridhol was destroyed by itself and named Shadar Logoth, Shadow's Waiting.\nThey then go to sleep but Rand wakes up on Lan's return. Lan tells Moiraine that there are Trollocs inside the gates before he starts waking the others. Moiraine tells them that they will make for the river where she can raise a small ward while they make rafts and cross over, or they may be able to hail a trader's boat from Saldaea. Lan explains that neither Trollocs or Myrddraal can swim and that they loathe deep water. The Aes Sedai commands them to get to their horses, as they're not yet over the river."

The Aes Sedai shouts lowly for him to stop, which he does. The fog is completely covering the streets, and it grows slowly. Lan and Moiraine ride slowly up to the fog which separates them, and when Nynaeve asks what it is, the Aes Sedai tells her about Mashadar, the evil of Shadar Logoth, which kills you by a mere touch and cannot be destroyed, even by the whole White Tower.\nMoiraine points to a star and tells them to follow it, as it will bring them to the river. She and Lan then ride off, leaving the others alone. Rand leads the others in a half trot, and when they round a corner, a wall of fog closes the way. They wheel around and ten spans away, two Trollocs step into the street. Then another pair of Trollocs appear and another, and another, and another. They start howling, before they bound forward. Rand tries to gather the rest, but everybody has split up, and as he's pursued by three Trollocs, he speeds up.\nRand meets Mashadar again, but he manages to get himself through. The Trollocs and the Myrddraal which has hung on, try to go through, but get killed by the fog. After some time he meets Mat, who tells him that he's only seen Trollocs. They ride out of the gates, and suddenly Thom appears from behind, shouting for them to ride faster. Rand hears hunting cries, announcing the Trollocs on their trail."

None of them have seen anybody, and they ride out of the gate.\nSuddenly a Trolloc horn sounds behind them, and Trollocs start howling. Perrin leads Egwene into a gallop, but she falls behind and when he turns to urge her on, he rides right off the edge of a bluff into the Arinelle. The Trollocs start throwing spears at him and as he floats downriver, he swims against the other bank. As he reaches it, he calls out the names of his friends, but gets no answer."

Thom appears behind the Trollocs and kills two, but one of them runs away to alert others.\nThey reach a low bank and decide to go downriver. They meet a large trader's boat, and just as he is about to answer a question from Rand, Trollocs burst into the clearing. They run onto the boat and manage to wake the crew. They fight the Trollocs and get the boat out in the water. The captain gets angry with Floran Gelb as he was asleep when he should have been on watch and hadn't secured the boom. When Rand tells the captain that they must go back and pick up their friends, he commands Mat, Rand and Thom below.\nIn his cabin, he introduces himself as Bayle Domon, captain of the Spray. Thom says that he is a gleeman and that Mat and Rand are his apprentices. He goes on to telling a story he has made up about how he ended up where he is. When Thom tells him that they have little money, the captain suggests that Rand can give him his sword, something he denies. Mat and Rand then give him the silver coins they got from Moiraine, and Domon says that he can take them to Whitebridge.\nThom takes Mat and Rand on deck and growls to them that he could've gotten them passage for some songs and stories if they hadn't been so quick to show silver. Rand walks to the rail and stares up the river, and Thom comes up to him and tells him that he can't do anything, and that the others are probably safe with Moiraine and Lan."

She warily watches the woods for Trollocs as well as the ground ahead of her for any tracks that'll help lead her to the boys and Egwene.\nNynaeve catches the scent of wood smoke and stalks through the woods to a clearing where Moiraine and Lan are speaking. Hiding behind a tree Nynaeve listens to Moiraine and Lan talk about the Trollocs the night before and wonder how they'd gotten so far from the Borderlands so quickly. Moiraine tells Lan that she'd done some searching and says that one of the boys is across the river and there is a faint trace of the others downriver.\nMoiraine senses Nynaeve and tells her to come out and Lan whirls around drawing his sword. Nynaeve feels some satisfaction that the Warder was unaware of her. Nynaeve approaches Moiraine demanding to know what dirty Aes Sedai schemes she got Egwene and the boys into. Lan raises his arm and bars Nynaeve's way. Moiraine tells Nynaeve that she can wield the One Power and that's how she could sense her. Nynaeve thinks that the Aes Sedai is trying to off balance her and denies what Moiraine says.\nMoiraine talks of the people in Emond's Field telling her about all the wonderful things their young Wisdom could do. Nynaeve only answers that Mistress Barran taught her well. Moiraine goes on saying that some years ago there must've been something Nynaeve wanted more than anything else and she got it. Moiraine says that Nynaeve must've Healed either Egwene or Perrin and that is how she had found them at the inn in Baerlon.\nMoiraine tells Nynaeve that she is lucky to have managed crude control of the Power, that if she hadn't, it would've killed her as it may kill Egwene if she is untrained. Nynaeve replies that if she could learn to control it, so could Egwene. Moiraine says that the reactions from using the Power will eventually lead to a violent death that would last days and that there is nothing that can be done once it's begun.\nNynaeve also learns from Moiraine that she has great potential and with training could become even more powerful than Egwene who could be one of the most powerful in centuries. Nynaeve asks hesitantly for Moiraine not to tell anyone about this.\nWhen asked about the boys, Moiraine says that the Dark One wants them and that she opposes anything the Dark One wants. Moiraine tells Lan that they will be heading south and that the Wisdom will not be accompanying them to which Nynaeve replies that she will, thinking to herself she will not leave the Emond's Fielders alone with an Aes Sedai.\nLan goes to recover Nynaeve's horse and Nynaeve smiles, thinking that he'll never find her tracks. Moiraine says she'll be able to find the boys by a token she had given each of them. Two of the boys have lost their coins though, so Moiraine believes they will need her help first even though the third boy is only a few miles away across the river. Nynaeve is worried about Egwene, but the Aes Sedai says it's the boys the Dark One wants, not Egwene.\nLan returns with Nynaeve's horse and they set out south."

Perrin asks her not to use the One Power and she refuses asking him if he'd give up his axe or walk around with one hand tied behind his back.\nOne afternoon they find Queens Crown mushrooms and begin laughing and telling stories they remember of Emond's Field.\nThey smell smoke of a cook fire and Perrin goes to see what it is, telling Egwene to wait where she is. Perrin goes off and peering around a tree discovers a lean sun browned man resting near the fire. His clothes made of furs. The man peeks an eye open and invites Perrin and his friend over for something to eat. Perrin calls for Egwene and introduces himself to the man. The man then introduces himself as Elyas Machera. Perrin gasps when he notices Elyas eyes were as yellow as polished gold.\nEgwene shows up and Perrin introduces her while she eyes the cooked rabbits Elyas has over the fire. They eat and Elyas asks them what they're doing out in the wilderness. Egwene answers that they're headed for Caemlyn and Elyas laughs, telling them they'll pass a hundred miles north of it going the way they were.\nEgwene asks Elyas if he would show them the way and he responds saying that he doesn't like people much and that cities are full of them. He says he doesn't go near villages or farms much, that people don't like his friends. Egwene wants to know which way to go then Elyas tells them to be quiet, that his friends are coming.\nFour wolves appear and lay down by the fire. Perrin notices more wolf eyes in the darkness around them, he reaches for his axe and Elyas tells him not to do that. Perrin leaves the axe alone.\nElyas named the four wolves by the fire; Dapple, Hopper, Burn and Wind. Perrin wondered how Elyas could talk to them. Elyas says that the wolves are the ones that discover the people not the people them. Elyas tells them that the wolves approached where ever he went. And then they seemed to know what he was thinking and responded to him. He says that wolves and men have not hunted together for a very long time.\nEgwene finds it interesting and wants to know if speaking to the wolves can be taught. Elyas says that it can't be taught, but that Perrin can do it. Perrin shifts uncomfortably.\nElyas still wants to know what they're doing out there and Egwene tells him a story her and Perrin had worked on in case they ever meet anyone. Elyas tells them that they're lying. That the wolves told him so. Perrin then tells Elyas the truth. When Perrin finishes his tale, Elyas says that he doesn't hold well with Aes Sedai, that the Red Ajah wanted to gentle him. And that no Aes Sedai would take kindly to him after he killed a couple Warders. Elyas says it's bad business to kill Warders and that he doesn't like it. Elyas goes on to say that talking to wolves is older than Aes Sedai and doesn't have to do with the One Power.\nElyas offers to Perrin and Egwene to stay with him and the wolves, that it'd be safer for them. Egwene says that they're going to Caemlyn then Tar Valon and Perrin agrees after a sarcastic conversation with himself. Elyas says he and the pack will travel with them, that Dapple says so and she leads the pack.

Ba'alzamon, surprised, fades away.\nRand turns full circle and stares at thousands of reflections of himself staring back. Ba'alzamon appears in each of the reflections behind Rand's own image staring at him, their faces merging together.\nRand starts awake and searching around with his eyes realizes he is aboard the Spray. He is relieved at first until he notices his finger - pricked on the thorns in the dream - is bleeding. Rand's breath catches.\nThe Spray continues down river, Domon drives his crew hard trying to make good speed, all the time reminding them of the Trollocs that attacked them days earlier. Domon hangs up the Trolloc weapons for all to see whenever the crew begins to feel like the danger has passed.\nGelb tries causing trouble for Rand, Mat and Thom, but the crew won't listen to him thinking that it's Gelb's fault in the first place that the Trollocs attacked the ship. Rand is concerned Gelb will cause them trouble but Thom thinks they have more to worry about from the crew if they mutiny.\nThom entertains Domon's crew and at the same time teaches Rand and Mat to be his apprentices teaching them some of the easier stories, some tumbling and juggling.\nRand watches the shores pass by and notices a tower of polished metal. Domon makes a few comments about the tower, that it's two hundred feet high and has no mark or opening on it. Mat says he bets there's treasure inside. Domon agrees that there may be and then goes on telling about a few other strange sights in the world. He makes a comment about when the Emond's Fielders go back to their home that it'll be too small to contain them. Rand disagrees and says he will go home some day and raise sheep like Tam. Rand then asks Mat if he's right and Mat, pulling himself away from looking at the tower says of course they'll go home, then walks off muttering about treasure.\nA few days pass and Rand sits upon the mast of the ship watching the crew and everything else. He nearly falls at one point and laughs about it. Thom and the crew watch him, thinking that Rand has gone mad and tell him to come down. Rand slides down the mast and jumps to the deck right in front of Mat. Rand stares at Mat and what he held - a curved dagger with a gold scabbard and a ruby the size of Rand's thumb nail. Mat notices Rand and stuffs the dagger back in his coat. Rand asks if it came from Shadar Logoth and Mat tells him that Rand cannot tell anyone about the dagger.\nRand also asks Mat if he has had dreams lately. Mat has, but doesn't want to talk about them.\nThom comes over before Rand or Mat can say anymore about dreams and tells them that he convinced Domon that Rand's fool stunt up on the mast was part of his training.

Perrin can feel the wolves and tries to tell Egwene that she doesn't need to worry to which she replies that she isn't worried.\nElyas tells Egwene that the wolves are far enough to avoid any people they meet, yet close enough to help if there is any danger.\nEgwene insists everyone take a turn riding, even Elyas. Elyas replies that his legs are good enough for him. Egwene tries to argue that it makes sense to take turns, but Elyas just looks at her with his yellow eyes and she backs away.\nPerrin feels the wolves around them, when they come, when they're ahead, when they're behind. In his dreams wolves are always nearby. Elyas gets food for Perrin and Egwene, they eat well while with him, but Perrin feels that he'd just as well starve than travel with Elyas and the wolves.\nAs they approach a large grouping of trees, three dogs as tall as the wolves and heavier appeared snarling and baring teeth. Perrin gets his sling ready, but Elyas stops him. Elyas raises a finger and whistles high and shrill, the dogs growling ceases and they step back watching his finger. Lowering his whistle and finger together, the dogs lay down happy as pups. Elyas pats the dogs and says that there will be Tuatha'an, Tinkers. Egwene doesn't like the idea of meeting Tinkers, she thinks they're thieves. Elyas says they steal no more than any other folk and Perrin says he's always wanted to meet a Tinker and suggests they stay with them for the night. Elyas says they may as well stay with them, but not to listen to what the Tuatha'an say. Elyas thinks their views are foolishness. As they walk into the woods, Perrin feels the wolves stay back. The wolves avoid people and were contemptuous of the dogs that gave up their freedom.\nThe Tinkers camp consisted of colorful wagons that were more like houses on wheels. The Tinkers themselves wore clothes as colorful as the wagons, so colorful it hurt Perrin's eyes to look at. The Tinkers played music and danced, children played with dogs. The music and merriment stops as Perrin, Elyas and Egwene walk up and everyone stares at them. A man, Raen-the Mahdi (old tongue for 'Seeker' - the leader of the Tuatha'an people) approaches and says they are welcome to their fires and asks if they know the song. Elyas replies with a bow and says he does not know the song. The man then says they will continue to seek then and welcomes them to dinner, the merriment picks back up again.\nRaen and Elyas already know each other from years back. Egwene asks about the song that was mentioned and Elyas says that it is what they seek, that it was lost during the Breaking of the World and when it's found again the paradise of the Age of Legends will return. Elyas says the Tinkers don't even know anything about the song but believe they'll know it when they find it.\nThey join Raen at his campfire and meet Ila, Raen's wife and Aram their grandson. Aram takes a liking to Egwene. Aram mentions the Way of the Leaf and Egwene asks about it. Aram explains that the leaf lives its appointed time, doesn't struggle against the wind, does no harm and lastly falls to the ground to nourish new leaves. Perrin asks what it means and Raen replies that no man should harm another person whatsoever. Raen says 'violence harms the person who does it as much as the one who receives it.' Elyas grows impatient with the talk and calls for enough of it, he says people don't like Tinkers because they preach their Way of the Leaf and that it lures young folk away from their homes. Raen is patient with Elyas and Perrin's views. Perrin tells Raen he doesn't look for trouble, but if someone caused some for him, he'd give it back to them. Egwene finds it interesting to meet someone who doesn't think his muscles can solve everything. Aram invites Egwene to show her the camp and she accepts going off with him. Raen says Aram is a good lad, but seems to find the Way of the Leaf a hard way to live.\nThey eat dinner and after lighting their pipes, Raen tells a tale about a band of Tinkers crossing the Waste two years earlier. The Tinkers encountered a group of Far Dareis Mai-Maidens of the Spear who had gone into the Blight and were returning when they were attacked by Trollocs that had followed them. The Maidens were all dead save one who crawled to the Tinkers wagons to give them a message despite her loathing of them. \"Leafblighter means to blind the Eye of the World. He means to slay the Great Serpent. Warn the People. Sightburner comes. Tell them to stand ready for He Who Comes With the Dawn.\" and as she continued her warning message, she died. Raen thinks Elyas might know something, but he doesn't.\nPerrin thinks over the Aiel woman's message and wonders about Elyas when Egwene returns, singing to herself. Egwene says Aram is a nice boy and she had fun dancing, laughing and eating dinner with him. Egwene suddenly throws her arms around Perrin and weeps into his shirt begging him to tell her that their friends are alive.

Thom raises the question of what Rand and Mat intend to do if they do not find Moiraine in Whitebridge. Before the boys can answer the ship arrives in Whitebridge.\nCaptain Domon tells Floran Gelb to get off his ship and offers Thom and the boys passage to Illian if they will keep the crew motivated to work as hard as they have on the way to Whitebridge. Thom wants to take the offer but the boys want to search for Moiraine, so Thom tells Domon he will consider it.\nThom takes Rand and Mat to the town center passing the White Bridge - a remnant from the Age of Legends that gave the town its name. They enter The Wayfarers' Rest and ask Innkeeper Bartim for a place where they can talk in private. Bartim leads them to a table and offers Thom a room and a meal for a good price if he will perform tonight. Thom says he will consider it, and tells the boys when Bartim has gone to get them a drink that the offer is cheap.\nWhen Batrim returns they ask him for news. Bartim tells them about the false Dragon Logain, how he was captured and that he can channel. He also tells them something about the Hunt of the Horn being called in Illian. Thom considers going to Illian again. Rand inquires after their companions while Thom is lost in thought for a moment. The innkeeper's reaction to that is peculiar. He wants them to leave as soon as they finish their drinks. After some more questions they learn that both Fain and a Fade inquired after them.\nThe Innkeeper leaves again and Thom urges the boys to take Domon's offer. Rand and Mat still refuse. Mat is on the brink of violence and clutches his dagger. At that moment they hear Gelb telling stories about Trollocs chasing Domon's ship. Thom now sees himself forced to abandon the plan to go to Illian. Rand and Mat want to know why Thom stays with them. Thom tells him about his nephew Owyn who got in trouble with Aes Sedai. Rand suspects Owyn could channel but Thom doesn't admit that. They decide to sneak out of the inn and make a run for it to Caemlyn.\nThom divides their coin into three shares and they sneak out of the inn. Thom hands Rand his things while he goes to get another cloak to replace his gleeman one. As they head for the road to Caemlyn a Fade appears. Thom turns to face it and tells the boys to run and go to an inn in Caemlyn called The Queen's Blessing. Rand and Mat hear Thom cry out in pain as they flee towards the Caemlyn Road. Mat thinks Thom is dead, but Rand has trouble accepting that."

He erases the tracks at their camps, evades the ridges of hills, where they could be seen for miles around, and even sends out the wolves to scout ahead. The wolves cannot tell Perrin what makes Elyas uneasy though. When Perrin asks what they are running for Elyas reacts agitated but does not give a straight answer.\nWhen they approach a hill that stretches for miles in either direction there is no other choice than to go cross it. Perrin joins Elyas scouting and when they reach the top they spot the first ravens. A small group, maybe fifty or a hundred, but they are convinced these are eyes of the Dark One.\nAfter that Elyas pushes for more speed and tells the wolves to watch the skies (something wolves normally don't do). They spot ever bigger groups of ravens closer and their journey becomes a dash for a 'place of safety' as Elyas calls it. At one point the wolves let Perrin know the ravens are behind him as well. Perrin is forced to tell the others and Egwene immediately realizes Elyas is right and Perrin can talk to them. Perrin refuses to discuss it though. Ravens now cloud the sky. Several times Egwene's and Perrin's slings are all that save them from being detected. They see animals that have fallen victim to the ravens and at one point they even see the ravens kill a fox. Perrin also feels the ravens attack the wolves before they are being drawn away by the real prey of this hunt.\nJust as Perrin and Egwene are about to collapse from exhaustion, Perrin feels a chill going through him. Elyas tells him they have entered a stedding, the home of Ogier only known in stories in the Two Rivers. The eyes of the Dark One will not follow them there. They are safe for the moment.\nElyas leads them to the only place where there is water in the abandoned stedding. Egwene notices the remains of a statue at their campsite which looks like it has hosted generations of travelers before them. Elyas tells them it was a statue of Artur Hawkwing, the king who ruled all the lands between the Aryth Ocean and the Aiel Waste. Elyas tells them his story as they rest by the campfire. Perrin's mood is low that night. He still will not accept the wolves as a part of him. He also wonders if he could have killed Egwene to spare her from being torn to pieces by the ravens if they had caught up with them."

Bornhald gets ever more convinced Perrin and Egwene are Darkfriends. Perrin decides to tell an edited version of the truth but Bornhald does not buy it. He tells the prisoners they will be taken to Amador for interrogation. This triggers loud protests of Child Byar who has been hostile to Perrin and Egwene from the beginning. He claims they will slow the Children down on their way to Caemlyn and that there is only one penalty for Darkfriends. Death.\nBornhald tells Byar not to be overzealous. He advises Egwene to think of a better story, preferably the truth, if she wants to escape being handed over to the Hand of the Light. He also makes it clear that a gibbet waits for Perrin for killing two Children of the Light."

She decides to take Bela and one of the other horses she is with and unties Bela's lead rig. Moments later Moiraine starts her diversion. Lightning comes crashing down, and the horses flee in all directions. Nynaeve is stunned when she sees wolves chasing the scared horses away but is too busy getting away from the camp to pay much attention to them."

One night Byar steps into the tent they are held in, like he has done before to tell them about what awaits them in Amador. This time, however, he offers Perrin escape. Perrin is surprised by this offer--Byar is convinced they are Darkfriends, after all--and he hesitates to accept. Just as Perrin starts to reply he gets a message from Dapple: help is underway. The next moment Perrin sees the guards go down and Lan stepping into the tent. Lan knocks out Byar and starts to untie Egwene and Perrin.\nThe Warder tells them they are not saved yet and that they have to take a white cloak. Perrin takes Byar's even though he can almost smell the man on it. A few moments later lightning starts crashing down around the camp and Lan, Egwene and Perrin leave the tent in search of Moiraine. They meet her just outside the camp. Egwene wants to know where Mat and Rand are, but there is no time to answer that question. Moiraine tells Lan Nynaeve hasn't returned yet. Lan is ready to go looking for her but Moiraine stops him, reminding him, Lord of the Seven Towers, of his oaths. At that moment Nynaeve comes crashing through the bushes with Bela and a second horse. They flee the camp while the Whitecloaks are still confused but not before Egwene finds out Mat and Rand are not with them.\nWhile they move south towards the Caemlyn road Perrin feels Dapple touch his mind once again. She tells him they'll meet again and leaves. Lan circles back a few times to look for signs of pursuit but finds none. Not much short of dawn they halt to rest. Nynaeve tends to the bruises Byar caused Perrin and notices the irises of Perrin's eyes are yellow. She has never seen this before, and she's worried. Moiraine recognizes what it is but won't tell Nynaeve. She only says it won't hurt him directly.\nBefore they go to sleep the Warder tells Perrin that his eyes are not a thing of the Dark One. He wants to know if Perrin met a guide, and Perrin tells him about Elyas. Lan knew Elyas. It turns out he was a Warder before he ran with the wolves. Lan won't say much about him; he only indicates that there was trouble with the Red Ajah. Lan has a great deal of respect for Elyas though and wants to know if he is alright. Perrin tells him he thinks Elyas is okay. Lan observes that Perrin obviously is significant for the weaving of the Pattern in some way and that his choices are probably limited. He thinks it is a good thing Perrin is back under Moiraine's supervision and says that the other two boys should be found soon or all may be lost."

The innkeeper describes him as a beggar. He also tells Rand to leave through the alleyway. The front of the inn is being watched by the faction that blames the Queen and her Aes Sedai advisor of all wrongs in the city.\nOut on the street the tension is almost tangible. Violence between those supporting the Queen, indicated by the red armbands, cockades or wrappings, and those who oppose her, indicated by the color white, seems only a matter of time. Rand, still wearing his red wrappings, heads in the direction of the Inner City, where he thinks he has the best chance of seeing the Queen and Logain. He joins in with the crowd's song. In the Inner City, Rand runs into the beggar Master Gill was talking about. The beggar yells out and tries to reach Rand. Rand runs off without looking where he's going.\nAfter he shakes off the beggar he finds himself in an unfamiliar part of the Inner City. He tries to find a good spot to watch the false Dragon. Rand hears the drums and trumpets accompanying Logain and the Aes Sedai guarding him. Rand climbs a wall to get a good look. He sees Logain being guarded by four Aes Sedai, all concentrating very hard. He wonders out loud why they do that. A girl's voice replies they are shielding him from the Source. Rand is so surprised he loses his balance and topples off the wall backward. On his way down he hits his head and passes out."

They are both very finely dressed. The girl tends to Rand's cuts, obtained after climbing the wall and falling off it. It takes Rand some time to realize he is in the company of Elayne, the daughter-heir of Andor and her brother Gawyn.\nWhile they are talking, Elayne and Gawyn's half brother appears. Galad has come looking for them because they left their quarters to see Logain against the Queens orders. Galad, an extremely handsome man, sees Rand as an intruder. Elayne tells him not to call the guard but Galad does the \"right thing\", as he always does, according to Gawyn, and calls them. Before Elayne and Gawyn can sneak him out of the garden the guard arrives.\nThe guard, led by an officer named Tallanvor, think Rand is a serious threat. Elayne steps between Rand and the guardsmen and claims guest right for Rand. Tallanvor wants to lock Rand up until the Captian-General Gareth Bryne has time to question him. Elayne wants to be led before the Queen and tells Tallanvor she will join Rand in the cell if he intends to proceed. The stale-mate is broken by a messenger summoning them all to appear before Queen Morgase.\nOn their way to the Queen, Rand notices the Gardens are green and flowering despite the weather. Elayne tells him this is the work of Elaida, the Aes Sedai advisor of the Queen. They are led to one of the smaller halls, Gawyn seems to think this is a favorable sign.\nElaida and Lord Gareth are in the presence of the Queen when they are led before her. Morgase begins by lecturing Elayne and Gawyn about their responsibilities and disobeying her orders before she turns her attention to Rand. Elayne requests to speak and tells her mother what happened. She calls Rand a loyal Andorman. The Queen is skeptical. She knows very well the Two Rivers do not consider themselves part of her Realm.\nElaida has a close look at Rand and points out that he doesn't have the look of a Two Rivers man and that he carries a heron marked blade. This doesn't support Rand's claim to be a shepherd. She Foretells that Rand will be at the center of the turmoil the world will face soon. When the Queen asks the Captain-General for his opinion, he councils to keep Rand locked up until Logain and Elayne and Gawyn, who will be traveling to Tar Valon to receive training, are well on their way.\nQueen Morgase, however, feels Caemlyn is becoming too suspicious and wants no part of it. She recognizes Two River speech, both Elaida and Bryne have never heard it, and can't see any evidence Rand means them any harm. She decides Rand should be seen out of the palace unharmed but warns him to be more careful in future. Elayne and Gawyn see him out. Elayne tells him she thinks Rand is handsome and favors him with a dazzling smile. Gawyn seems to think this amusing. Rand asks Gawyn why everybody has a hard time believing he is from the Two Rivers. Gawyn replies Rand looks like an Aiel."

Rand accepts hesitantly this time.\nTheir conversation is interrupted by a maid. She tells Master Gill there are Whitecloaks in the common room.

Rand realizes this can only be one lady and runs into the kitchen to greet Moiraine. After introducing Moiraine, Lan, Egwene, Perrin and Nynaeve to Master Gill the company is sent upstairs to Rand and Mat's room so she can have a word with the innkeeper.\nMat is suspicious of the company, asking if they are who they say they are and wondering how much they have changed. Nynaeve thinks he's ill and wants to treat him for his fever. At that moment Moiraine joins them. She immediately senses something is wrong with Mat and tells them to stay away from him. She physically drags Nynaeve away from Mat. When Moiraine tries to find out what is wrong with Mat, he tries to stab her with the dagger Mat took in Shadar Logoth. Lan is just in time to stop him.

She tells them Darkfriends and Shadowspawn can sense the evil in Mat miles off.\nRand tells Moiraine that they ran into Darkfriends several times during their trip to Caemlyn. Rand also thinks there are Trollocs and Fades in and around Caemlyn. Lan confirms there are a great number of Trollocs gathered around Caemlyn waiting to go into the city to look for the boys.

He tells about a man who came to the stedding at the end of the Aiel War, some twenty years ago.

This reminds Perrin of a story he heard among the Tinkers of an Aiel Maiden saying the same thing. This news troubles Moiraine greatly.\nPerrin thinks that it is time now to tell Moiraine about the dreams Mat, Rand and he have been having. Moiraine is very displeased the boys didn't bring this up sooner. She thinks she could have helped them but it is too late now. She explains to the boys how they can keep Ba'alzamon from hurting them in their dreams by denying him.

On Moiraine's insistence Loial tells them about the time of madness when channeling men sought shelter from the Dark One's taint in the stedding. Eventually these men all left but not before they gave the Ogier the gift of the Ways. A place where time and space have another meaning, a way to travel great distances in a single day. Outside each stedding a Waygate, an entrance to the Ways was placed and outside each of the Ogier built cities. During the War of the Hundred Years however the Ways started to get corrupted, they grew dark and people started disappearing or came out mad. The Ogier Elders concluded it was no longer save to travel the Ways and forbade its use.\nAfter hearing this Nynaeve wants to know why Moiraine means to take them to such a dangerous place. Moiraine makes it quite clear that they have run out of options. Giving up is handing the world over to the Dark One. Staying in Caemlyn means certain death and leaving the City another way does too. Reluctantly everybody agrees to try the Ways.\nThey spend the rest of the evening planning their trip. Moiraine sends for Master Gill to get them the things they need.

Ba'alzamon tries to tempt him to kneel to him by offering him power beyond imagination and threatens him with eternal pain if he refuses.

Each Island has a Guide, a big slab of stone covered in Ogier script, saying which bridge leads where. All of the Guides and bridges seem damaged, eroded by time, but Loial can still make out which bridge they need to take.\nLoial leads them across a series of bridges consulting a Guide at each Island. The damage to the Guides and bridges seems to vary but Rand questions the stability of most. At midday Lan signals a brief stop to hand out a meal. They eat in the saddle though.

He tells about the nation of Malkier which not fifty years before lay north of Shienar and Arafel and about its royal family. King al'Akir Mandragoran and his brother Lain were as close as brothers could be but Lain's wife Breyan was jealous because Akir was on the throne and not her husband. On a dare by his wife Lain rode into the Blight to lead his lances in an expedition to Shayol Ghul, the seat of the Dark One. Lain and most of his party were slain, weakening Malkier's defences.\nBreyan blamed the King for her husband's death and plotted against him with a man named Cowin Fairheart. They sent Malkier into chaos and civil war. At this point Fairhart, who was a Darkfriend, led the Trolloc hordes into Malkier. The defenseless nation was overrun quickly but not before the King and Queen managed to get their baby son Lan to safety in Shienar. While Lan grew up learning about the Blight and battle in Shienar, what was left of Malkier was gradually swallowed by the Blight. Al'Lan Mandragoran is the last king of Malkier, a king without\u200b a land, engaged in a war he can't win or end.\nAll of this is hard for Nynaeve to swallow but before they have chance to discuss it further Moiraine and Lan join them again. The company is curious about what they learnt from Fain. Moiraine is appalled by the evil in Padan Fain, he is beyond being a Darkfriend. He told her he was summoned to Shayol Ghul as early as three years ago to receive instructions from Ba'alzamon. Since that time he has been hunting for the three boys. It was Fain that found them in the Two Rivers, Fain that lead the Trollocs and Fades to Emond's Field and Fain that brought the Shadowspawn back on their trail after Moiraine set a false trail near Baerlon, all the while he was treated like an animal by the Fades. Fain started to hate the Dark One to the point where he wanted to break free.\nAt Shadar Logoth he finally saw his chance. He fled from his tormentors but soon found he couldn't get rid of the urge to hunt the three boys. He followed them to Caemlyn and even through the Ways to Shienar. Moiraine is still unsure why Machin Shin fled when it found him but the fact alone sends shivers of fear through the company. Lord Agelmar again offers men to accompany them in the Blight and offers shelter for the boys who are inexperienced in his eyes. Moiraine refuses again. She intends to leave for the Blight early the next day."

At the border their escort leaves them. Intgar will try to reach Tarwin's Gap in time to join the fighting. He dislikes the fact he may come too late.\nThe party crosses into what was once Malkier. The landscape gradually changes until it is corrupted beyond recognition. The cold spring of Shienar is replaced by a damp heat. The Blight has its effect on the company. Especially Loial seems upset. Lan and Perrin are relatively untouched by the Blight. Lan sets a hard pace and warns them not to touch anything. There are many things in the Blight that can kill.\nLan's intention was to reach the passes across the Mountains of Dhoom before nightfall but they won't make it. Moiraine suggests a camping site where she and Lan stopped before. Moiraine sets wards to warn them if any creature of the Dark One comes too close. Despite this Rand can't sleep. He lies awake and overhears a conversation between Nynaeve and Lan. Nynaeve wants Lan to marry her but Lan refuses, despite his love for the Wisdom. He tells her he will not make Nynaeve a widow.

He ends up on a hilltop, but when he walks to the end hoping to find a goat path or some track, he looks down a sheer hundred-foot drop. When he turns around, Aginor is there. The Forsaken walks up the steep hill as if it is level ground. Rand notices that his drawn parchment face seems less withered than before, as if Aginor has fed well on something.\nThe Forsaken says that the Dark One will give rewards beyond dreaming to the one that brings Rand to Shayol Ghul, but why should he share power and bend knee to Rand? As he talks, Rand feels something and though he knows\u200b there is nothing to see, he sees a glowing rope from Aginor, connecting the Forsaken to something distant beyond knowing. The rope pulses, and with every throb Aginor grows stronger, more fully fleshed. Yet beside the glowing cord, Aginor seemed not to exist.\nA bright finger-strand drifts towards Rand and fills him with heat, building up warmth; the warmth and radiance of light, of the Light. Aginor shouts \"You shall not have it! It is mine!\", and suddenly flames shoot from his mouth and eyes, leaving him screaming.\nThe Light is blinding Rand's mind, stunning him with awe. He stands in a mountain pass, surrounded by the tail end of a battle, and he can see the banners of Fal Dara, Shienar, Dha'vol, Ko'bal and Dhai'mon.\nHe has humans on one side and Shadowspawn on the other, and when a Myrddraal points at him, Draghkar fly down towards him. He feels the heat of the touched sun again and from the clear sky, a lightning bolt strikes each Draghkar. He falls on his knees, screaming, as a wall of fire envelops the Trolloc host, leaving it highly reduced.\nA voice rises, making Rand's skull vibrate, saying that only the chosen one can do what must be done. Steps rise, stretching up into the murk that obscures the sun. The human forces launch their last charge, and seeing as he will get trampled over by the horses, Rand steps on the first step, causing him to be surrounded in darkness. He continues walking, till he reaches a wooden door, and when he enters, he finds himself standing in the chamber from his dream. He finds Ba'alzamon seated in front of the fireplace, and notices that he also has a cord, though his is black. He tells Rand that he only has one choice: to kneel before him, but Rand denies him. Ba'alzamon shows him his mother, who tells him that the Father of Lies is stronger than he once was. As she disappears screaming, Rand finds himself with a sword of light, of the Light.\nBa'alzamon shouts that he cannot wield it so until he has taught him and that Rand will destroy himself, but as Rand cuts the black cord from his back, he hurls into the fireplace, and as Rand's cord thins out, he walks over to Ba'alzamon and flames fill the room. Rand falls through endless black, and is struck with tremendous force, turning him to jelly, screaming from the fire raging inside and the hungry cold burning without end."

He starts shouting that Shai'tan is dead, naming the Dark One because he thinks there is no more need for caution.\nWith some effort, he manages to get on his feet and down the hill, and when he reaches level ground, he starts running. He thinks about Egwene, but can't remember who she is. When he reaches the clearing, he starts shouting for her, and when he finds her with Moiraine and Nynaeve, he starts remembering.\nThey talk about what happened, and the Aes Sedai explains that the two Forsaken probably were trapped near the surface, and that the patch on the Dark One's prison weakened enough to free them. When Rand wants to tell them that he killed Shai'tan, she corrects him and says that they should still call him the Dark One, or at least Ba'alzamon. He then understands that he was wielding the One Power. Moiraine has already told Nynaeve and Egwene, so they are not surprised when he understands, but the Aes Sedai makes him tell her everything that happened in detail.\nThe others return from the cavern with a large gold chest ornate with silver, a big bundle of folded cloth and fragments of pottery. When they see Rand, they tell him how good it is to see him alive and that the women stopped them from looking for him.\nWhen Mat asks how come the things they found in the Eye weren't destroyed, Moiraine tells him that they weren't put there to be destroyed, and takes the pottery pieces from Mat. She puts it together into a perfect circle, with the ancient symbol of the Aes Sedai: the Flame of Tar Valon, joined with the Dragon's Fang. She gives Lan a knife, and he picks the largest fragment and brings the knife down with full force. There is not a mark on the piece, and the Aes Sedai says that it is cuendillar, heartstone, and that once made, nothing can break it. When Mat wonders how the piece was shattered, she tells him that it is one of the seals on the Dark One's prison.\nMoiraine then opens the gold chest, and inside there is a curled, gold horn. It only has a line of silver script inlaid around the mouth of the bell, and the Aes Sedai says that it must be carried to Illian. Moiraine hands the horn to Loial who can read the Old Tongue, and the Ogier reads out loud: Tia mi aven Moridin isainde vadin, the grave is no bar to my call. Lan appears shaken and there's a touch of awe in his voice as he says it is the Horn of Valere.\nThe Aes Sedai wonders whether the Eye of the World was made for the use they put it or to guard the items. She then asks for the cloth, and Perrin gives it to Lan and Loial who unfold it and hold it up. It is the banner used by Lews Therin Telamon, the banner of the Dragon.\nMoiraine says that they will rest and sleep before going on. With the Green Man gone, there is no one to hold the place away from the Blight, and Rand sees that dead leaves are falling from the trees already. When he asks the Aes Sedai if it's done, she tells him that what they came to do is finished, and that he from now may live his life as the Pattern weaves."

He walks over to the tree and starts singing in a rumbling voice as if the earth sings. When he is done, the leaves on the oak seem greener, and the flowers circling it stand straighter.\nThey then ride out into the Blight, and though Rand half expects their group to be attacked like they were on the way in, nothing moves or attacks them. Lan chooses a campsite just before sunset, and the next morning the Blight fades as they come further south. Twisted trees are replaced by straight, and slowly the forest around them becomes red with new growth, and it is as if spring now had raced to catch up to where it should be.\nWhen they reach the border, men come out of the watchtowers to greet them, laughing with joy as if they can not believe the new grass under their feet. They tell about a great victory for the Light in Tarwin's Gap. They reach Fal Dara in the afternoon where the soldiers newly come to Fal Dara celebrate the victory and the spring. When they meet Ingtar, he is the only one not happy as he came an hour too late to see. Moiraine insists on them being brought to Lord Agelmar. When they meet him, he tells them that the men says the Light took on flesh and fought for them, and that the Creator walked in the Gap, but that he only saw a man, and what he did cannot be. The Aes Sedai replies to him that the Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills. After making sure Padan Fain is secure, she shows him the Horn of Valere, but refuses him to use it to march to the Blasted Lands and level Shayol Ghul, but asks of an escort for it to Illian where it belongs.\nSeven days later, Rand finishes his sword practice with Lan in Agelmar's private garden and meets Egwene.

As he looks around the room, a serving girl clad in white offers him a drink; Bors, afraid both of seeming untrusting and of poison, accepts without any intention of drinking.\nEveryone in the chamber, including Bors, is wearing a black mask, although a quarter of them have not bothered with disguises beyond the masks. As Bors studies the other people, he marks out a woman from Illian, and another from Arad Doman. There is a Shienaran man, and people from Kandor, Cairhien, Saldaea and Ghealdan. Merchants, warriors, commoners, nobles...all are represented in this crowd, and Bors even spots a Tinker. As he continues to look around, he finds that even though others are disguised more thoroughly, he can still tell who they are. He sees a High Lord of Tear, an Andoran Queen's Guard and an Atha'an Miere. And then, suddenly, his eyes catch sight of something surprising; an Aes Sedai, or at least a woman who has been trained in the White Tower, wearing a gold serpent ring. He quickly looks away, only to find himself looking upon another, and he silently curses them.\nA chime sounds, and the tall door at the far end of the chamber swings open, allowing two Trollocs to enter. They ignore the humans, and simply turn towards the door, bowing and cringing. They are followed by a Myrddraal. Everyone is shying away in fear, and for a time, the creature does not speak. Finally he announces: \"Your master comes. To your bellies, worms! Grovel, lest his brilliance blind and burn you!\" Bors is overwhelmed with rage, more so at the tone of the Myrddraal's voice than its words, until the air above the Myrddraal's head begins to shimmer.\nBors immediately drops to the ground as the import hits him. \"It can't be!\" he thinks to himself. He notices that the Trollocs were on the ground even before he was.\n\"The Great Lord of the Dark is my Master, and most heartily do I serve him to the last shred of my very soul,\" the Myrddraal tells them. Meanwhile, Bors is frightened nearly to death, and keeps reminding himself that the Dark One and the Forsaken are bound in Shayol Ghul. \"The hand of the Creator shelters us all, and the Light protects us from the Shadow,\" he thinks to himself, before he reminds himself that he now serves a different master.\nA mellifluous voice tells the humans to rise, and Bors looks up in shock, only to see the figure of a man floating in the air above the Myrddraal. He is masked in blood red. Bors wonders why the Great Lord of the Dark would appear to them as a man, and masked. Yet the Myrddraal is cowering, so Bors thinks that perhaps it is one of the Forsaken. The figure tells them to call him by the name of Ba'alzamon, striking great fear into everyone in the room.\nBa'alzamon informs them that the chamber they are in stands in the shadow of Shayol Ghul, and several people moan at this pronouncement. He continues on, almost mockingly, telling them not to fear, as the day of their Master's rising is near at hand and that the Day of Return draws near. He says that soon the Wheel of Time will be broken and that the Great Serpent will die, and that the Great Lord will remake the world in his own image. \"And those who serve me, faithful and steadfast, will sit at my feet above the stars in the sky and rule the world of men forever. So have I promised, and so shall it be, without end. You shall live and rule forever.\"\nThe air to the left of Ba'alzamon begins to shimmer, and the figure of a young countryman appears, mischief in his brown eyes and the hint of a smile on his lips. The air to Ba'alzamon's right shimmers, and another countryman appears, a curly-haired, yellow-eyed youth with heavy muscles and a battle-axe hanging at his side. A third figure appears, directly under Ba'alzamon's eye, almost at his feet. This one is tall, with dark, reddish hair, and a heron-marked sword hangs at his side. Ba'alzamon tells them that one who walks the world will become the Dragon Reborn. The Shienaran man asks eagerly if they are to kill him and Ba'alzamon tells him perhaps yes, perhaps no. He informs them that he wishes to have the Dragon Reborn turned over to his side. He tells them all to study the images before them so that they can recognize the three men.\nEveryone begins to shift uneasily, except, Bors notices, for the Illianer woman; she is acting as if she is speaking to someone in front of her, though he cannot see whom and cannot hear what she says. She nods, her eyes half terrified, half ecstatic. Then she arches her back and rises to her toes, as if some unseen hand is holding her up; when she settles back to her feet, she is shivering, nodding and bowing. As she straightens, the woman next to her...one of the Aes Sedai...begins nodding as if she is now being spoken to.\nEventually, the red-masked face of Ba'azalmon fills Bors' vision. Ba'alzamon asks him if he is faithful, and Bors swears that he is. Ba'alzamon then gives Bors his instructions. He is to return to Tarabon to continue his work there and is told to redouble his efforts. He is also to watch out for the three young men. Thirdly, he is to speak to no one of those who have landed at Toman Head. Ba'alzamon continues giving instructions, and they make no sense to Bors. He then feels hands grasping his head, and images flash through his mind. A sky of striated clouds, red, yellow and black, driven by a mighty wind; a woman dressed in white who recedes into blackness; a raven staring him in the eye; a man in armor with a helm shaped like an insect; a curled, golden horn; a wolf ripping out his throat; the skies raining fire, and the moon and stars falling; rivers running in blood, and the dead walking; the earth splitting open and fountains of molten rock...\nSuddenly, the images are over and Bors finds himself half-crouching in the chamber while Ba'alzamon moves on to speak to a Tairen lord. Bors is then led away to his room by another white-clad servant."

Rand concentrates on the flame and the void, feeding all of his emotions into a single flame until emptiness surrounds him. For a few moments, he and Lan trade blows with bundled lathes. They are trading blows back and forth when something unexpected happens to Rand. The wind, howling across the tower, freezes as if it had turned to jello, and begins pushing Rand forward. Lan quickly gets the advantage, and demands to know what 'fool move' Rand was trying to use. \"You know better by know, or should unless you have forgotten everything I've tried to teach you.\" Rand tries to explain what had happened, but Lan just stares at him and then helps him to his feet. \"Strange things can happen this close to the Blight,\" he says.\nRand wonders how Lan can act as if nothing happened, but his thoughts eventually drift to his heron-marked sword, which he picks up. The sword leads to thoughts of his father, Tam, and he once again begins to doubt the fact that Tam really is his father. Lan seems to almost read his mind and tells him that in the Borderlands, if a man has raised a child, then that child is his no matter what.\nRand remarks that he has to learn how to use the sword, and Lan tells him that he could always sell it. \"That blade is rare even among heron-mark swords. It would fetch a pretty price.\" Rand refuses, and says that he had thought all heron-mark blades were rare. Lan glances at him and says, \"Tam didn't tell you, then? He must know. Perhaps he didn't believe. Many do not.\" Lan then proceeds to tell Rand that, during the War of the Shadow, many weapons had been wrought with the One Power - such as Rand's sword. Rand is startled and jerks away from his weapon. \"I can't get away from them, can I?\" he asks. Lan ends up asking Rand if that is what he really wants - to get away from Aes Sedai - and then asks that if this is so, why hasn't he left yet? Rand replies that he hasn't left because Mat and Perrin are still in Fal Dara and he doesn't want to leave before they do, for fear that he might not see them again for a long time. The conversation turns to Egwene, which seems to be another reason that Rand is staying in Fal Dara. Lan asks Rand if he would have her accompany him, to give up a life in the Tower for a life of wandering, and Rand replies that he wouldn't let her go with him even if she asked.\n\"And that is all the reason? You want to spend as much time as you can with your friends from home before they go? That's why you're dragging your feet?\" Rand finally gives in and tells Lan that it is Moiraine, and Lan replies that he would be dead if not for Moiraine. They talk for a moment about circumstances between Rand and the Aes Sedai, and are about to get back to training when they hear a faint peal of trumpets. They see a large procession moving through the city, and upon seeing a banner bearing the Flame of Tar Valon, realize that it is a group of Aes Sedai. Rand asks Lan why there are so many of them, and Lan tells him that it is because the Amyrlin Seat has arrived in person. They end their lesson, and Lan tells Rand that it would be better if he was a week gone."

As he makes his way through the halls, several people call out to him, saying that the Amyrlin Seat is there, and that she probably wants to see him and his friends. When he reaches his room, he finds several women clearing out his clothes, as well as Perrin's and Mat's. He demands to know what they are doing, and Elansu, the Shatayan of Fal Dara keep, tells him that Moiraine wants them to have new clothes, which Lady Amalisa had ordered made for them. They tell him that he is to change out of the clothes that he is currently wearing; he does, and finds that he now has a whole wardrobe of new clothes.\nHe quickly changes, and then packs his bags, intending to leave Fal Dara as soon as he can. He grabs his Two Rivers long bow before he leaves.\nOn the way to the stables Rand sees the entourage of the Amyrlin Seat. As he passes he hears the welcoming ceremony as the Amyrlin Seat is welcomed into Fal Dara keep. Agelmar welcomes them by saying, \"Fal Dara offers bread and salt and welcome. Welcome is the Amyrlin Seat to Fal Dara, for here is the watch kept, here is the Pact maintained. Welcome.\"\nRand hurries by, more intent then ever on leaving. When he arrives, he sees Tema, a stablehand. Tema informs Rand that an order has been passed out that no one is to leave the keep. Rand asks if the order had come from Lord Agelmar, and Tema tells him that it must have. He then remarks, \"The Welcome is finished, my Lord. The Amyrlin Seat will be sending for my Lord, and my Lord's friends, to come see her now.\"\nUpon hearing these words, Rand takes off at a run."

              "pov_summary": "Upon learning that the Amyrlin Seat will soon be sending for him, Rand is desperate to leave Fal Dara. He makes his way towards the sally gate, but finds that it is closed tight and guarded by Ragan and Masema. Rand tells them that he just wants to go out and hunt rabbits, but they inform him that Lord Agelmar has ordered that no one is to leave the keep. Rand laughs, asking why Agelmar would want to keep him inside the keep. Ragan and Masema do not have an answer for him, but will not let him leave. Rand finally says that he will just go walk in the gardens instead.\nRand, however, does not go to the gardens. He makes his way to the Carter's Gate, but finds that it is locked and guarded as well; it is the same with the Dog Gate. He is discouraged, and very afraid that the Amyrlin will find him and gentle him. He begins to wonder if it would really be so bad to be gentled, but recalls that men who are gentled almost always die soon afterwards. He makes his way through the keep, and finally ends up in a storeroom. He finds a semicircle of men kneeling in front of one of the walls, throwing dice. Loial is watching them, and the Ogier greets Rand before beginning to speak of the Amyrlin. \"She looks tired, don't you think? It cannot be easy, being Amyrlin. Worse than being an Elder, I suppose.\" Loial continues to say that the men will not dice with him, but simply say \"Glory to the Builders,\" whenever he suggests playing with them. Rand suddenly remembers that it was the Ogier who built Fal Dara, and asks Loial if he knows any way out of the keep other than through the gates. Loial tells him that though the Ogier built Mafal Dadaranell - an ancient city that once stood where Fal Dara now stands - that Fal Dara had been built by men. Rand insists that he needs to get out of Fal Dara. Loial, thinking that Rand is sick, calls for Mat and Perrin.\nBoth of the other Two Rivers boys appear, and they ask Rand why he thinks that he must leave. Finally, Mat asks how they will all get out of the keep, and Rand realizes that Mat and Perrin intend to accompany him. Knowing that he must go alone, Rand says some harsh things to them. \"Maybe I don't want you two going with me, always hanging around, falling into trouble and expecting me to pull you out. You ever think of that? Burn me, did it ever occur to you I might be tired of always having you there whenever I turn around? Always there, and I'm tired of it.\" Perrin looks hurt at his words, and Mat's face becomes stiff, and they leave. To get rid of Loial, Rand says, \"You are no use to me if you don't know a way out. Go on! Go find your trees, and your precious groves, if they haven't all been cut down, and good riddance to them if they have.\" Loial is shocked, and leaves. All of the Shienaran gamblers are staring at him, and he stumbles out of the storeroom.\nRand begins searching for somewhere that he can hide, but can't find a place that he thinks is safe enough. Eventually, he runs into Egwene. She tells him that she heard from Mat, Perrin and Loial what had happened earlier, and is very displeased. He doesn't care, and tries to get rid of her, too. \"There are plenty of Aes Sedai here for you to moon around, now. And don't tell any of them you saw me. They're after me, and I don't need you helping them.\" Egwene becomes upset that Rand thinks she would help the Aes Sedai capture him. He turns to walk away, but she throws herself at him, knocking them both to the floor. In an attempt to keep him from leaving, she sits on him. Rand threatens to do something to her with the One Power, but she tells him that, \"I know you cannot channel the One Power whenever you want; it just happens, and you cannot control it.\" She, on the other hand, has been taking lessons from Moiraine. To prove it, she channels, and a torch bursts into flame. Eventually, Rand tells Egwene what Lan had said earlier, and she decides to help him, suggesting that they go to the dungeon. Wary, he tries to jump to his feet, but Egwene assures him that he will not be hiding in a cell. She also mentions that Padan Fain is down there, and that since she often goes to visit him, no one will question their going into the dungeons.\nAt the door to the dungeon, they encounter Changu, who asks what they want. After he recognizes Egwene and asks who Rand is, he leads them to Padan Fain's cell. As Egwene approaches Fain, Rand hangs back; Padan Fain announces that he can feel that Rand is there, and says that Rand will never be able to hide from him. He then chants:\n'Soon comes the day all shall be free. Even you, and even me. Soon comes the day all shall die. Surely you, but never I.'\nEgwene backs away from him and Rand says that he has gone mad. Egwene says that perhaps this was not a good idea. \"Even if they don't look here, I cannot stay here with him like this, and I do not think you should, either. There is something about him today that....\" She stops, and then announces that she will take him to the women's apartments. \"... they will never look in the women's apartments. Never.\"\nAs they leave, Fain calls after them, \"It's never over, al'Thor. Never.\""

As she finishes readying herself, she hears a knock on her door. When she opens it, two Aes Sedai stand at the door; Anaiya of the Blue Ajah, and Liandrin of the Red. Anaiya and Moiraine greet each other as old friends, but Liandrin acts coldly, telling Moiraine that the Amyrlin Seat requires her presence.\nThey begin to make their way through the corridors, and Liandrin tells Moiraine that three false Dragons have surfaced - one in Saldaea, one in Murandy and one in Tear, though only the one in Saldaea can actually channel. As they continue to walk, they run into the Lady Amalisa. She curtsies, and Moiraine tells her to rise, greeting her warmly. As they talk, Moiraine notices Egwene hurrying around a corner with a stooped figure following behind her. When she turns her attention back to the other three women, she is just in time to catch Liandrin accepting an invitation to tea from Amalisa. This causes her to wonder what Liandrin is up to, as the Red sister doesn't often make friends outside of her Ajah, and never makes friends who are not Aes Sedai.\nAfter Amalisa leaves, the talk turns to Andor. Moiraine is told that Morgase doesn't hold her throne as securely as the year before, but that there is also good news: the Daughter Heir is in Tar Valon. The conversation shifts once again, this time to the Great Hunt of the Horn, which has been called in Illian. Many people believe that the Last Battle is coming; the Sea Folk are agitated, and the Aiel appear to be stirring. Liandrin then mentions Almoth Plain, and Anaiya insists that it is simply a rumor. The rumor is that there may be fighting on Almoth Plain, and perhaps Toman Head as well. Moiraine and Anaiya speak shortly about this, and Liandrin finally gets impatient. She tells Moiraine that the Amyrlin is waiting for her, and mentions that, \"for you, the Amyrlin will have no idle talk.\"\nThey finally reach the anteroom, and are greeted by several more Aes Sedai. Verin Mathwin, Serafelle, Alanna Mosvani and Carlinya are among them. Leane, the Keeper of the Chronicles, enters and leads Moiraine into the next room, where the Amyrlin Seat awaits. Moiraine and Siuan greet each other formally, and Siuan speaks of their journey to Fal Dara. Moiraine goes on to tell Siuan that she has two girls who can channel with her. Siuan then mentions that she has heard that Moiraine is 'meddling' with a young man who is ta'veren, and that Elaida has approached the Hall of the Tower about this, wanting to see Moiraine punished. Moiraine admits that she has found three ta'veren.\nThe conversation turns to talk of change, of how new alliances are being formed within the White Tower, and of how Aes Sedai are now daring to go against thousands of years of custom and law. Finally, Siuan asks Leane to leave so that she and Moiraine can talk in private. When the Keeper leaves, Siuan wards the room, and then she and Moiraine embrace. They speak of how they have a duty that must be fulfilled, and the chapter ends with Siuan saying, \"Moiraine, if anyone, even Leane, discovers what we plan, we will both be stilled. And I can't say they would be wrong to do it.\""

Moiraine finally breaks the silence and says that Leane would never betray Siuan. Siuan counters with, \"Would she think it betrayal? Is it betrayal to betray a traitor?\" Moiraine simply says that they must do what they must do, and that the Prophecies must be fulfilled. Siuan begins to speak of Amyrlins who have been stilled in the past, of which there are only two, both of them from the Red Ajah: Tetsuan and Bonwhin. She adds that she has no wish to be the third to lose the staff and stole.\nMoiraine demands to know if Siuan wishes to give up. The Amyrlin replies that she will not give up, but says that she does not want to watch everything slide out of their hands. \"We had a plan! A plan, Moiraine! Locate the boy and bring him to Tar Valon, where we could hide him, keep him safe and guide him.\" She continues to say that in ten years, she has only received two messages from Moiraine. Moiraine tells her that the Pattern pays no heed to the plans of humans, and that they are dealing with a ta'veren that is stronger than even Artur Hawkwing. \"The winds of destiny are blowing, Siuan, and we must ride them where they take us.\"\nThere is silence for a while, before Siuan reaches out to run her hands over a flat, gold cube; it contains the Horn of Valere. She mentions how Agelmar had pushed it into her hands as soon as he could, not knowing whether to consider it a curse or salvation. From the Horn of Valere, talk turns to the Last Battle and the Karaethon Cycle. Siuan is afraid that perhaps Logain, or Mazrim Taim, is the real Dragon Reborn...and then what? Logain is already gentled, she reminds Moiraine, and there are already sisters in Saldaea to capture Taim. Moiraine informs her that neither of them is the Dragon Reborn.\nOnce discussion of the Horn of Valere has ended, Moiraine presents the broken cuendillar seal to the Amyrlin. Siuan is reluctant to admit that it is one of the seals on the Dark One's prison, but she knows that it is.\nThe talk next turns to Rand. Siuan tells Moiraine that she saw him in the courtyard, and asks if he can channel. Moiraine informs her that yes, he can. She also says that for the moment, he is safe to those around him, and that she has purposely let him think that she doesn't care what he does or where he goes. Moiraine suggests that they send Mat and Perrin to carry the Horn of Valere to Illian. She adds that there is a problem. The problem is that Mat carries a dagger from Shadar Logoth, and Siuan is aghast. They decide to attempt to Heal Mat in Fal Dara instead of taking him to Tar Valon. Going back to the topic of taking the Horn to Illian, they decide that Rand will eagerly take the chance to get away from Aes Sedai for a while, and that he will most likely want to accompany his friends. They talk for a short while about how Illian will follow whoever bears the Horn of Valere, and then Moiraine leaves."

Amalisa swears to do whatever Liandrin says.\nLiandrin begins to question Amalisa, saying that Moiraine came to Fal Dara with a Darkfriend.

Liandrin asks if it is true that Moiraine speaks with him (Padan Fain) often, and Amalisa says that she only speaks with him sometimes. Next, Liandrin asks where the three young men that Moiraine brought with her are. Amalisa replies that she does not know, and says that they are nice boys and cannot be Darkfriends. \"Not Darkfriends, no. Worse. By far more dangerous than Darkfriends, my daughter.

Amalisa replies that she will see that it is done. Next, Liandrin asks if Amalisa has ever heard of the Black Ajah. Amalisa panics, swearing that she does not believe in its existence. Liandrin finally informs her that it is real, that there are Black sisters within Fal Dara, and that she must beware all Aes Sedai except for her.\nLiandrin finally leaves and goes on about the 'explicit orders' that she has been given by an unnamed person."

Perrin has torn out his eyes and is desperately trying to show Rand and proclaiming that he has \"gotten rid of them.\" Fain and Ba'alzamon both tell him that he can't hide before Rand awakens on Egwene's floor with Nynaeve knitting beside him.\nAfter a short dialogue in which Nynaeve accuses Rand of becoming too \"Shienarian\" he is told that Egwene went to help Padan Fain. Nynaeve informs Rand that the women have been acting odd, as if searching for something. Once again though it breaks into an argument when Rand names the Dark One and defends the action by claiming he is dead. It is evident Rand himself is not so sure when a wave of dizziness washes over him and he is once again reminded of the wind.\nThe alarm bell then goes off in the keep. Rand's first thought is they are looking for him. Nynaeve assures him that is unlikely because the bells would only warn him. Rand then figures out that it probably has something to do with Fain. Nynaeve desperately tries to convince him not to run out into the women's apartments. Reminding him that the women have been acting odd, and even if they hadn't they wouldn't take kindly to an armed man running through their quarters.\nRegardless, out Rand goes, to the dismay of the women and straight into the Amyrlin. He doesn't spend much time dwelling on this blunder or listening to Leane yelling at him and instead hurries on to where he encounters three Trollocs. He is not left alone to kill them as twelve Shienarians come to his aid. Rand doesn't wait to see the result and once again takes off running only to encounter a Myrddraal which Ingtar insists on taking himself; telling Rand that he should practice on some Trollocs first.\nAshamed at his cowardice he runs for the dungeon to notice the first oddity, a partially open door. Inside he finds chunks of flesh and the heads of the two guards. On the walls written in Blood are the words: \"We will meet again on Toman Head. It is never over, al'Thor.\" Desperately he tries to scrub off the message and in his panic fails to notice Liandrin's entrance until she uses the power on him to try to make him speak. Before serious harm is done Moiraine comes in and interrupts the struggle. Rand uses the moments of tension between the two Aes Sedai to explore further in the dungeon. The two prisoners left alive kill themselves from the horror they witnessed in the dungeon. It is then that Rand notices an unconscious Egwene and Mat.\nIt is quickly discovered that Mat's dagger is missing along with Fain. Liandrin points out that Rand was seen erasing the writing on the wall. Rand gets an uneasy feeling that even Moiraine is weighing him on this account. It is soon decided that Mat must be healed by the Amyrlin. Ingtar informs Rand that the Horn of Valere was stolen out of the storerooms. On further questioning it is revealed that the invaders entered and exited through the Dog Gate. Rand starts suspecting Ingtar but shakes the idea away.\nRand notices Verin for the first time studying the Trolloc script and describing it as \"interesting.\" He decides he doesn't want to get to know anyone who finds dark prophecies interesting. Lan finds Rand and tells him the women are already discussing which daughter would be best to marry to Rand. However, it is the news that Moiraine has said he can go anytime he wants now that interests him most."

Instead he is told to enter with the women giving him sidelong looks.\nWhen they confront Leane Sedai she comments on Rand's behavior, saying he was not so sure earlier. When he enters he sees Verin Sedai, Moiraine Sedai, Leane Sedai and, of course, the Amyrlin. Lan is informed he is not allowed to enter but before leaving whispers to Rand \"Tai'shar Manetheren!\" Rand is instantly worried about being gentled. The Aes Sedai grumble about Lan \"getting at him\" with his \"Warder ways.\" When the Amyrlin questions about the sword Moiraine tells her of how Tam found Rand. She has Verin test the blade. Rand is given a choice to go with Ingtar to retrieve the Horn and Mat's dagger or to stay behind alone. He chooses to go with Ingtar. It is after this that Siuan lets him know she knows he can channel. Rand protests, saying he doesn't want to and will not channel ever again. Siuan tells him he will channel whether he wishes to or not and had better learn to control it.\nRand asks why she isn't gentling him and Siuan tells him it's because he is the Dragon Reborn. Rand again protests and tells them he will not be a false Dragon on a leash. He lists off other false Dragons from the past. When they demand to know where he heard those names he tells them that Thom told him.\nThe Amyrlin still insists that he is the real Dragon Reborn and has Moiraine tell of the story of how he was found on the slopes of Dragonmount and how they dedicated themselves to searching for him.

Rand grows frustrated because all he wishes to do is apologize. Soon the party comes upon some Trolloc tracks. Ingtar says they will continue to ride at the same speed regardless. Uno gives Rand a look which makes him nervous. Eventually Ingtar realizes the horses can't keep going at that pace so they dismount and trot beside them. Eventually night comes and they stop for the evening.\nRand goes to unpack his clothes but is upset because they are all extremely fancy. Ingtar tells him that Moiraine personally saw to the packing. After getting food from Masema, who is his usual crotchety self, he goes and sits with Ingtar, Mat, Perrin and Loial. He is pleased to see that Mat and Perrin don't move away from him this time. He questions Ingtar on why Uno and Masema keep looking at him strangely. He is told Uno is most likely wondering if he has earned the heron on his blade, and that Masema can't see anything but Aiel with him. Rand protests saying he is not Aiel, which is confirmed by Mat.\nThe next morning they once again start out, the pace just a tiny bit slower than the other day. They come across an abandoned camp where Hurin tells them that there was murder done. They ride northeast now until they come across another dead body and the direction again changes south. They continue like this until they come across the River Erinin. The village appears to be abandoned so Ingtar orders a search. They find nothing until Uno spots a woman in the window. When he gets there she is nowhere to be found. Instead there is a piece of drapery. Hurin says he has never smelled anything quite like what happened there before and is greatly disturbed by it.\nThey decided to continue on across the river. On the other side of the river they come across the brutally murdered bodies of Changu and Nidao. They bury them for there is no definite proof they were Darkfriends and they had saved Lord Agelmar's life earlier. They continue on again until they come across another village in their path. The village is also abandoned and Ingtar demands another search. Rand walks into one of the building and is trapped in a vision over and over again. In the dream the room is crawling with flies. When he finally snaps out of it he finds six dead flies. He doesn't have much time to dwell on it though before an alarm is sounded. He quickly runs to find a Myrddraal staked onto a door.

              "pov_summary": "Ingtar had called a halt to the day's march with the sun still golden above the horizon because the group are still suffering after going into the village. Uno is still insisting that he saw \"the same flaming woman as at the flaming ferry\" in the village they just passed through, though it is thought impossible for someone to travel that fast and stay out of their sight. Rand is still reeling from what he saw in that room; \"Maybe I'm finally going mad\". Ingtar insists on a strong watch during the night and that they are all prepared to leave quickly. Ingtar is obviously realizing that \"it isn't just some Darkfriends, and a few Trollocs and maybe a Fade anymore\". The camp was chosen because it could be defended easily in case of an attack.\nIngtar tells Rand that the village was deserted because the Trollocs had taken the inhabitants for food. Trollocs maim their victims, often without killing them first, \"and Halfmen like to have their fun\". However, he doesn't know what could have killed the Fade, or decides not to tell Rand. He instead gives Rand something from Moiraine and tells him that \"she said to tell you to take care of it; your life may depend on it\". He also tells Rand that if he is killed, Rand will be in charge. Rand is stunned at this revelation, \"I've never led anything but a flock of sheep\", and points out that Uno should be second. When they were in Fal Dara, Lord Agelmar told Ingtar and Uno that Rand was to be second, though Moiraine was obviously involved with this. Rand realized that Moiraine is still manipulating him, \"Moiraine's hand was bright and clear in it\". Every Shienaran soldier knows about this since \"every man knows who is next in line if the man in command falls\". Rand tries to protest again but Ingtar insists that he will do his duty and leaves, calling for scouts to be sent out.\nRand takes the package into the woods, not wanting anyone else to see what is in it. Moiraine had obviously wrapped the object herself and Rand finds that the package contains the banner of the Dragon. Mat and Perrin walk in on him and Mat is angry because he thinks that \"we'll hear no end of lording it now\". Then they both notice what the banner depicts and know what it means. Rand tells them that Moiraine is trying to set him up as a false Dragon, \"Moiraine wants me to be a puppet on Tar Valon strings\". He then admits that he can channel; Mat is very scared while Perrin takes the news calmly. Mat thinks that if the Shienarans know of it, \"they will cut our bloody throats for Darkfriends\". Mat wants to know why the Aes Sedai didn't gentle him and Rand explains that \"they are trying to use me\".\nMat thinks that Rand should \"be halfway to the Aryth Ocean by now\" and Perrin asks Rand why he is still with them. He adds that Ingtar would kill them if he knew. Rand explains that he wanted to help Mat find the dagger and the Horn, \"I thought I could stay with you until we found the dagger\". Mat is surprised by his answer, thinking that Rand was too busy acting like a lord to care. Rand explains that he \"was trying to get rid of you\" so that they wouldn't be hurt because he can't stop himself from channeling. Mat tells Rand that he won't stay near him much on their journey, \"you just are not the same any more\", and leaves. Perrin advises Rand to run, \"I'd run so far, so fast, no Aes Sedai would ever find me\", but then says that Rand might not be able to run. When he talks about not being able to run, Perrin is talking about his connection with the wolves. He then leaves Rand alone.\nRand thinks about his options and that perhaps Moiraine \"gave me this to make me run\". He decides to keep the banner and returns to the camp with it wrapped back in the packaging. Rand goes to join Loial and Hurin on the opposite side of the camp from Mat and Perrin. Loial is looking at a strange stone buried in the ground. Loial tells him that the stone was once a \"column of some kind\" and though he doesn't know what it could be, the markings \"look familiar, somehow\". Rand then lies down to go to bed next to the stone and drifts off into an uneasy sleep, surrounded by the Void."

Fain has the ruby dagger now and like Mat, he is addicted to it, \"it felt like a part of him\". Fain is surrounded by the remaining twelve Darkfriends and the twenty Trollocs who are waiting to feast on the captured villagers. Fain remembers how he killed the Myrddraal, \"the feel of the hammer in his hand, driving the spikes in\". He turns to the Trollocs and orders them to kill all the prisoners but to \"make a pile of everything that remains - for our friends to find\".\nThe Darkfriends are afraid of Fain and the Trollocs, aware that the Trollocs might kill them. Fain does little to ease their fears, \"What are you to me? Less than peasants\". The Darkfriends hurriedly tell him of their influence and powerful friends \"whom they knew in the Borderlands, in Cairhien, and other lands\". Fain doesn't listen to them and instead looks at the chest, wondering how to open it. He lays the dagger on top of the chest, a better guard than a Trolloc because \"they had all seen what had happened when he used it\". He stares towards the north, though he cannot feel Rand now. Sometimes, like now, \"the boy had suddenly vanished from his senses\". Fain thinks of Rand and how \"We'll dance on Toman Head, and I'll be free of you\"."

Both she and Nynaeve get close to the Amyrlin and learn that someone had hurt her, \"a bowman not yet caught\". She is not harmed too badly and insists on leaving at once, despite Lord Agelmar's protests that \"this attempt on your life changes everything\". The Amyrlin refuses to stay until they have caught the bowman and then sees Egwene and Nynaeve. Moiraine admits that they are the two new novices and the Amyrlin points out that \"I sense a fine spark in each of them\". Egwene is nervous because the Amyrlin is looking at her like she was a tool, \"This one for this purpose, and that one for that\". The order is given and the group mount quickly and are on their way. The group is followed by cheers but Egwene's mood is less than happy. Nynaeve comforts her by pointing out that Rand \"has Lord Ingtar and twenty lances with him\".\nThe group move as quickly as they can over the next few days and the \"camps came late each night\". Each Ajah had their own tent and their Warders slept outside it; the Amyrlin and Leane each have their own tent and Egwene and Nynaeve share one. Lan comes to their tent once to see Nynaeve but she erupts in anger and he doesn't come again, even though \"He stood watching the tent from the darkness for a long time before he went away\". Moiraine does not come near them while they ride, preferring to speak \"with the other Aes Sedai, all but the Red sisters, drawing them aside one by one\". Egwene thinks that she has forgotten them but Nynaeve is not quite so sure, \"I'll believe she is done with us when she's dead - or us\".\nWhile they rest at night, Aes Sedai visit their tent; the first is Verin Mathwin Sedai. She comes to teach Egwene some more about channeling. Apparently, the fact that Egwene has started to channel, and does not have a block that prevents her from channeling, may be dangerous for her. Nynaeve has some control over her channeling and so doesn't have to take part in the lessons, though she does, grudgingly. Most novices are scared of what they can do with the One Power but some, like Egwene, are eager to learn more. That is why \"there was nothing for it but for her (Moiraine) to begin teaching you\". Although there is not too much danger now, Egwene's \"innate abilities are strong, child, and they will grow stronger\". She must be taught thoroughly and fairly quickly so that she doesn't hurt the people around her or herself.\nEgwene and Nynaeve try to embrace saidar by using a flower bud in their minds as a focus, \"You and the bud are one\". Egwene feels \"The merest trickle of it (saidar) seeping through her\" but loses it when she tries to force it. Nynaeve complains that she cannot feel anything but Verin convinces her to stay by describing the novice chores. Near the end of the lesson, the blankets burst into flame, proof that Nynaeve had just channeled, though \"I didn't mean to burn anything\". Verin channels the fire out but it signals the end of the lesson. She warns them one last time of channeling too much saidar, \"If you draw too much, you can destroy yourself\". Other Aes Sedai come to their tent in the evenings; Alviarin Sedai, \"cool and businesslike\", Alanna Sedai, a typical Green, and Liandrin Sedai who questions them endlessly about Rand, Mat and Perrin.\nEgwene begins to dream of Rand again, though her dreams have changed by the time they reach Medo. Medo is where they board the boats that will take them to Tar Valon. After being waved aside by a Yellow sister, Egwene finds Anaiya Sedai and asks to see Moiraine. Anaiya tells her that \"Moiraine is gone\" and Nynaeve has already been bundled onto the River Queen, \"I had to bundle her onto a boat myself\". Egwene learns that Moiraine has left the group along with Lan and that Liandrin and Verin have also disappeared. Now convinced that she cannot speak to Moiraine, Egwene tells Anaiya about her dreams. In them, there was \"a man with a mask over his face, and fire instead of eyes\", Ba'alzamon though she doesn't know it, who scared her. Then, there was an evil woman standing over Rand, who was sleeping, and they disappeared suddenly in a flash of light. Egwene senses that there is danger not far off and that Rand is walking into a trap. Anaiya explains that there is a slight chance that Egwene might be a Dreamer, which is very close to Foretelling but \"it could be just an ordinary nightmare\". Anaiya tells her that they will \"talk about it more on the River Queen\". She then leaves Egwene to board River Queen herself."

What is even more alarming is that the stone they fell asleep next to is now upright in the centre of the hollow. The floor of the hollow is paved with white stone and there are steps up to the stone cylinder, each coloured in the same colours as the Aes Sedai Ajahs. The land around them is different too, \"everything seemed paler than it should be\". The land seems solid and so Rand wakes up Loial and Hurin; \"Wake up and tell me I'm dreaming\".\nImmediately both Hurin and Loial sense that they aren't in the same place they went to sleep in. Loial says that he knows what might have happened, \"I think I know what it (the stone) is now\". When Rand points out the coloured steps, Hurin thinks that Aes Sedai have done something to them, though Rand tries to comfort him, \"The Aes Sedai won't hurt you\". Loial explains that he read a book that contained a picture of a Stone like that, with emphasis on Stone. The book contained the quote \"From Stone to Stone run the lines of 'if', between the worlds that might be\". Aes Sedai from the Age of Legends used these Stones somehow, though only the most powerful of the Aes Sedai could use them.\nRand becomes uneasy at the mention of channeling as he went to sleep wrapped in the Void, \"Maybe I brought us here\". None of them understand the quote but Loial explains that the book had many questions in it about decisions; \"If a woman goes left, or right, does Time's flow divide? Does the Wheel then weave two Patterns?\" The book also said that there are lots of these Stones scattered around the land \"but I never heard of anyone finding one\".\nHurin speaks up then and seeks advice from Rand about how they are going to get home. He thinks that because Rand is a 'lord', he will see them out of this place. Rand now thinks that he sent them to this place and since \"you got him into this, you have to get him out\". He promises Hurin that \"I will do my best... by my House and my honour\". Hurin cheers up considerably, \"Hurin's grin was almost as wide as when Rand first met him\". Rand walks up to the Stone, convinced that it will get them back. Forming the void, Rand tries to reach for saidin but only feels the taint. He tries to form a picture of the original hollow outside the void and tries to push saidin into the picture.\nSuddenly, the void shatters \"into a thousand razor shards\" and Rand staggers back from the Stone, much to the puzzlement of Loial. Hurin is still standing confidently, still believing that Rand is going to get them safely home; \"as long as Rand was doing something, anything, Hurin would have confidence\". Rand says that he will try again in a few minutes but then Hurin suggests that they find the Darkfriends and force them to reveal how to get back. Rand is surprised that Hurin can still smell the trail and so Hurin explains that the trail is fainter, \"not old, not fainter like that\", and that they can follow that. Rand knows that they must find Fain, the Horn and the dagger and so decides that they will follow the trail. He sends Hurin off to find out if the trail is actually real.\nLoial has his doubts about leaving the Stone and wants to know how Rand was going to use the Stone since only channelers could use them. Rand answers that if they were around before the Age of Legends, there was the possibility that there would be another way to use them. Loial and Rand mount their horses and ride up to join Hurin. The world looks even stranger now; \"Whenever Rand turned his head, things that appeared distant when seen from the corner of eye seemed to rush towards him\". Hurin finds that the trail goes southwards and they begin to follow it, searching for the Horn."

Ingtar will not accept that they have vanished, \"three men and three horses do not just vanish\", and orders another search of the area. Mat suggests that they ran away, though the Shienarans do not take this well. Mat nearly lets slip of his, Perrin and Rand's conversation the day before, though manages to catch himself. Ingtar doesn't believe that Hurin would run away, nor Rand now that he knows his duty. Ingtar is very angry that Hurin has disappeared as they depended on his tracking skills.\nPerrin doesn't know any reason as to why Rand, Hurin and Loial would leave together, though he too thinks back to their conversation. He thinks of the reason why he is there and realizes that they must continue to hunt the Darkfriends and that he can help the group. He contacts the wolves, though he is reluctant to do so at first. When he first learned that he could communicate with the wolves, he felt unclean and \"he was still not past that entirely\". He forms contact with the wolves who are surprised, \"Wolfbrother.

It surprises him that he has a wolf name and \"wished he could not remember how he'd earned it\".\nPerrin sends the smells of Rand, Hurin and Loial to the wolves; his sense of smell has increased since he became a Wolfbrother. The wolves only know that the three entered the hollow and \"that was the last they had seen or smelled Rand or the other two\". Perrin knows that he will not find Rand or the others but he can help the group find the Horn, though it will mean telling Ingtar, \"The next step would be useless unless he told Ingtar\". He sends the wolves the smell of Fain, \"not even Trollocs smelled so foul\", and masks it with the smell of Trollocs.\nThe smell of the Trollocs drives the wolves into a frenzy, \"fire and Trollocs they hated, and they'd go through fire to kill Trollocs\". Strangely, Fain's smell is even worse to the wolves and they are eager to kill the Trollocs on their land. Perrin understands that the Trollocs are south of the group and that the wolves will leave immediately to start the hunt, \"Kill them. Kill the Twisted Ones\". \"Their fury injected him\" and Perrin snarls, much to Mat's surprise. Mat begins to feel that Perrin is not like he used to be either.\nPerrin finds Ingtar and pulls him aside, \"he made sure Uno and the rest were too far away to hear\". He tells Ingtar that the Trollocs are heading south and admits that he can talk to wolves. Ingtar doesn't question this since \"I have heard of things like this\". Ingtar accepts his story but asks Perrin to say that he is a sniffer because \"some of them (the Shienarans) would not understand\". The soldiers accept the story and mount their horses; however, Mat is very sceptical, \"I am the only sane one left from Emond's Field\".\nThey start riding and Perrin keeps in contact with the wolves, straining to keep the wolves from going ahead too far. If the Trollocs were killed by the wolves, the Darkfriends would scatter with the Horn and they would not be able to track it. Perrin sees images from the wolves of the bodies of the murdered villagers and tells Ingtar, haltingly, of what he sees. Ingtar tells the group of some more bad news, \"There is someone following us\".\nIt turns out to be Verin Sedai who rides up to their group. She announces that \"Moiraine Sedai sent me\" and talks of the village she just passed though, the village with the Myrddraal. She suddenly notices that Rand is not with the group and Ingtar tells her that he \"vanished last night, without a trace\". He is unsettled to know that Verin knows that Hurin was a sniffer, \"It was never easy discovering Aes Sedai knew the secrets you were trying to keep from them\". Verin is very intent on finding out all about Rand and decides to travel with them, and rides with Ingtar at the head of the column. Mat is right when he says \"It's Rand she's after... not the Horn\"."

              "pov_summary": "Rand, Loial and Hurin follow the faint trail in the unknown land, wrapped in silence. The strange way that the \"distant hills seemed to slide toward Rand\" makes him dizzy but the only way to avoid it is to be wrapped in the Void, something he wishes to avoid. Hurin is focused on the trail, \"as if he was trying to ignore the land the trail crossed\", and Loial has drawn in on himself. The land they ride across is charred and burnt but only in certain places. They all run east to west and are thicker in the middle than at the ends. Rand thinks of Whatley Eldin painting a cart and how the charred patches look as though \"someone had streaked it with a monstrous brush of fire\". The rest of the land also looks dead, \"though grass covered the ground and leaves covered the trees\". No birds or animals can be seen or heard and the rivers are empty of life. The water in the land is safe to drink but \"it tasted flat, as if it had been boiled\". When Rand looks at the sky, he sometimes sees unnatural clouds, \"The lines were too straight to be natural\", though he does not mention it to the others.\nMid morning, Loial stops riding and walks over to a tree. He begins to sing to it, though not like the Ogier treesongs Rand has heard before. The Talent for Treesinging is fading, Loial \"was one of the few who had the ability\", and that makes treesung wood even more rare. The song seems like \"pure song, music without words\" and as he sings, Loial touches the wood of the tree and the branch of the tree seems to respond to the touch. The song seems to be familiar to Rand, \"as if he should know it\". As Loial finishes singing, he holds \"a staff as tall as he was and as thick as Rand's forearm, smooth and polished\". Rand is surprised, \"I didn't know Ogier carried weapons\" but Loial tells him it is though \"this land was glad for a weapon to be made\".\nRand gives the order for them to start riding again to keep up with the Darkfriends. Later on in the day, Hurin tells them that there is something strange about the trail: \"It's like I'm remembering it, Lord Rand, instead of smelling it\". There are other trails of violence crossing their own trail, some seem to be so new that there should be some evidence of the violence done there but there isn't. There was one such patch just outside the hollow they had slept in, \"I could have sworn there were hundreds slaughtered right under my feet\". This sounds suspiciously like the slaughter of the villagers by the Trollocs in the other world.\nThey make camp in the evening and Rand is the first to stand watch. He thinks of Fain and hears a thin voice on the wind, \"It's never over, al'Thor\". For a while he forgets the strange land as he practices his sword forms, \"Parting the Silk. Hummingbird Kisses the Honeyrose\". He sits down again and keeps watch, going over his time so that the others don't have to be woken. He doesn't notice that a fog has rolled in and when he does, a man in black appears, cloaked in shadow. Behind the mask, fire is in place of eyes and Rand recognises him as Ba'alzamon. Rand thinks that he is in a dream, \"It has to be. I fell asleep, and...\", but Ba'alzamon laughs at him. He knows Rand's name and says that he has known \"every name you have used through Age after Age, long before you were even the Kinslayer\". He claims that they have been tied together since the First Moment, \"we are tied together as surely as two sides of the same coin\". Rand denies it, saying that the name Father of Lies is well suited to Ba'alzamon.\nBa'alzamon walks over to Loial and Hurin, saying that \"You find odd followers... You always did\". He mentions \"the girl who tries to watch over you\" who is Egwene but Rand confuses her for Moiraine. He claims again that Ba'alzamon is lying; \"even when you tell the truth, you twist it to a lie\". Ba'alzamon talks of the White Tower and how it \"means to use you like a hound on a leash\". He claims that he and Rand are so closely linked that they guide each other, though Rand once more denies it. Ba'alzamon says that they two have fought battles since the Creation but the Last Battle is coming and that if Rand dies, it will be finished, \"This time the Wheel will be broken whatever you do\". Ba'alzamon wants Rand to serve the Dark One but he refuses, \"I deny you, and I deny your power\".\nBa'alzamon tries to tempt Rand over to the Shadow with promises of immortality and shelter from the madness, \"The power can be yours, and you can live forever\". Rand refuses once more and Ba'alzamon causes the fog to catch fire and his \"sword glowed as if just drawn from the forge\". Rand hides in the Void and tries to cling to saidin in an attempt to block the pain from the burning. Suddenly, the fire is gone and so is Ba'alzamon; Loial and Hurin are still asleep and Rand thinks that he imagined it. Pain sears through his hand and he finds that his hand is branded with the heron from his sword. He wraps a kerchief around his hand and thinks to himself that he will not channel; that is what \"Ba'alzamon wanted to tempt him\" with and what \"Moiraine and the Amyrlin Seat wanted him to do\"."

              "pov_summary": "Rand, Loial and Hurin are leaving the campsite they stayed at. Loial notices the heron mark on Rand's hand but only sees that it is an injury. Rand does not welcome Loial's concern over the injury.\nWhilst traveling, they come across a \"tapering column\" that they believe could be Artur Hawkwing's spire for his victory against the Trollocs despite the fact that it had been torn down many years before. As they ride closer, a bird is visible on the spire and Rand believes that it is Hawkwing's hawk. On closer inspection, they see that it is a monument for Trollocs and that the 'hawk' is actually a raven. Loial explains that he believes that the world they are in is \"just a shadow of the real world. In this world, I think, the Trollocs won\". The spire is a Trolloc creation and celebrates their victory over Hawkwing.\nThere is no time to contemplate this as Hurin thinks that he spots a woman. Rand thinks of the Ways and warns the party to be very careful, despite the fact that they haven't been so far.\nA scream is heard, although in a different direction from where the woman was last seen, and Rand immediately goes to find out what is happening. He finds a woman cornered by a creature, later found out to be a grolm. He tries to kill it by shooting an arrow in to its hide but this doesn't work, only angering the beast as it charges at him. At the woman's urging, he uses the void and shoots an arrow in to the beast's eye, thus killing it.\nThe woman rides to meet Rand and Rand notices that she is extremely beautiful. She mistakes him for a Lord and Loial and Hurin for his retainers. Due to her beauty, Rand stutters and stumbles over his words as he explains his actions; \"A man who will not die to save a woman is no man\". She introduces herself as Selene, from Cairhien, and explains that she is not from the strange world; she entered it like Rand, Loial and Hurin did. Selene agrees to follow Rand and Hurin explains that they are after \"Darkfriends and Trollocs, my Lady\", as well as the Horn of Valere.\nThey ride, with Hurin following the trail, and Rand and Selene talk. Selene soothes Rand's heron mark injury while they talk about power. She says that \"Some men... choose to seek greatness, while others are forced to it\" and asks which one Rand will be, since sounding the Horn will give him power. This reminds Rand of what Moiraine has told him and asks if Selene is Aes Sedai. Selene denies this strongly; \"I am not offended, but I'm no Aes Sedai\". After this, Selene rides with Loial and Rand is left alone to wonder how they have managed to travel so far; \"More than a hundred leagues in less than three days\".\nAfter Loial's conversation with Selene, he explains to Rand that she has told him that they are in another world. \"These worlds... are reflections of the real world, she says\". They also find out that \"The Pattern has infinite variations... and every variation that can be, will be\". After this, Loial rides with Hurin and Rand and Selene talk.\nSelene praises Rand's ability with the bow and he tells her about the void. She recognizes this and calls it the Oneness, telling Rand, \"You'll learn uses for it that you never suspected\". Rand questions how Selene knows all about the Portal lands and then Selene tries to convince him to follow her to another Portal Stone. Rand becomes slightly angry and tells her to find the Portal Stone by herself and get herself out through it. Selene maintains that she does not know how and stays with the group. However, the conversation is broken by the \"coughing grunt\" of a grolm, followed by others. They discover that grolm are following them, \"a small pack, but they have our scent it seems\"."

Rand insists that he can kill the five grolm and leads the group up onto \"a low, round hill, bare of trees\". Using the void, Rand manages to slay each of the grolm by shooting it in the eye with an arrow. While Rand was still using the void, \"The light called to him, and he... reached... towards it\". This was an attempt to reach for saidin but he was interrupted by Hurin and the void shattered. Rand realizes that he feels alive when he reaches for saidin but the thought horrifies him; \"He wanted to go back into the void\".\nHowever, shortly after this, the group hears the barking of yet more grolm and Rand realizes that he can't slay all the grolm he will meet. He decides, at Selene's urging, to find the Portal Stone that Selene used to enter the Portal world; \"Lead us to this Stone, Selene\". Selene leads them to the Portal Stone, which is in a \"hollow nestled below them in the granite\". The group gather round the Stone and Rand seeks the void. Through the void, Rand is able to channel saidin in to the Portal Stone, \"He was one with the Portal Stone\".\nThe channeling allows the four of them to return to the real world. However, Rand's first thought is that he wants to continue to hold on to saidin but \"he let it go regretfully\". Selene tells him that what he did was \"remarkable\", transporting four people and their horses. Rand however, doesn't know what he did to activate the Portal Stone and asks Selene to not tell anybody about the Portal Stones since he doesn't \"understand it, and neither will anybody else\". Selene promises to keep it a secret.\nThere is a problem though because Hurin has lost the scent of Fain and the Trollocs and Rand fears that they have lost them for good. Selene then explains that some events \"have a shadow of that reflection even before the event occurs\" and so they have been tracking where the Trollocs are going to be.\nRand then wishes to send Selene back to Cairhien but she refuses, saying, \"A few days will see if I'm right\". She then reminds Rand of the power the Horn will give him but he \"doesn't want anything to do with legends\". They then decide to find a camp before darkness falls and while they are riding, Hurin promises that \"I'll never sleep again without first seeing what kind of stone there is nearby\". The plan for the following days is to find where they left the trail and wait for Fain and/or Ingtar and the others."

She returns to the cabin and Nynaeve tells her that \"we'll reach Tar Valon today\". The two women then talk about the dreams that Egwene has been having; she believes that \"Rand is in some kind of danger\". Anaiya Sedai has apparently taken interest in Egwene's dreams since \"she knows there is something in these dreams\". It appears that Egwene is dreaming of Ba'alzamon as she describes a \"man in the mask\" who has fire instead of eyes.\nThe Amyrlin visits the cabin and gives the girls their lesson of the day. Although Egwene is eager to learn, Nynaeve wants to go on to the deck for the duration of the lesson but her seasickness prevents this. The Amyrlin has been told that Nynaeve has a temper \"like a fisher-bird with a bone in its throat\" but agrees that she should be an Accepted rather than a novice. The Amyrlin shows them a sword and a knife made of Air when Nynaeve says that she would rather be taught how to use a sword than channel.\nAfter this, Nynaeve loses her temper and describes her frustration of doing simple things, \"Light the candle, Nynaeve. Now put it out. Light it again\". The Amyrlin then shows them how to stop someone by binding them using Air. She does this to Nynaeve and lifts her in to the air for a punishment. However, Nynaeve learns the weaves quickly and binds the Amyrlin using Air. The Amyrlin then cuts Nynaeve off from the Source, something she didn't know could happen. Then, the Amyrlin lets go of her own weaves and the lesson continues.\nThe lesson went well for Egwene, although the Amyrlin \"had coaxed out every last drop of effort\". She can now produce a flame that will \"dance from fingertip to fingertip\". The lesson did not go so for Nynaeve as she refused to let her anger get the better of her and so couldn't channel. The Amyrlin tried many different ways to make her angry but this didn't work.\nAfter the lesson, the ship arrives at Tar Valon and everybody leaves the ship, leaving Nynaeve and Egwene to leave the ship on their own. Once they are off the ship, Sheriam Sedai, Mistress of Novices, meets them. She tells them that the White Tower and the Shining Walls were built by Ogier, \"Their best work ever, some say\". She warns them that some novices \"break under the strain\", which doesn't make either woman more confident. Nynaeve is also warned that \"the first few weeks of being one of the Accepted is one of the hardest periods. With this, Sheriam Sedai leads Egwene and Nynaeve to the White Tower."

They have stayed where \"the trail had been, in that other world\" but Rand wants to \"take Selene to Cairhien\" and leave the trail. Each day Selene has talked him out of it and so they have stayed on the trail, waiting.\nRand thinks of Egwene and her journey to become Aes Sedai, thinking that \"the next time she sees me, she'll probably try to gentle me\". When he sees Thom's cloak and harp that he has kept, he ruefully thinks that \"I was happy then, I think, even running for my life\". It is obvious that the pressure is getting to him.\nHis musings are cut short when he sees Selene \"bending over his saddlebags, her hands on the buckles\". Selene says that she wishes to clean her dress and was looking for one of his shirts to change into. This she does although Rand stammers protests about him seeing her, as \"It would not be proper\". Once more Selene talks to him about \"the glory that will come\" to him when he has the Horn and how \"You can be another Artur Hawkwing\".\nHurin runs into the campsite that night, saying that there is \"a fire, my Lord, down in the hills\". Rand realizes that it is Fain and the Trollocs because Ingtar would not try to hide a fire. He wants to follow them in the morning and have Ingtar catch up but Selene convinces him to go down and check that it is Fain and to take the Horn if it is. Rand takes Loial, since he \"can see better by moonlight than you\", and together they take their horses down the mountain.\nAs they ride, Rand seeks the void because \"he needed the emptiness\", convinced that he would not touch saidin. They dismount close to where the fire was and see that it is in fact Fain and the Trollocs. They miss detection by the Trollocs as they are lazy, \"apt to give up any task but killing\", including guard duty. A moonbeam illuminates the chest of the Horn of Valere and Mat's dagger and Rand crawls to it, followed by Loial. Loial lifts the chest and they walk carefully away through the sleeping trollocs.\nHowever, at the edge of the sleeping Trollocs Fain realises that the horn has been taken and wakes up the Trollocs; \"It's gone! Wake, you filth! It's gooonnne!\" Rand urges Loial to run and turns to face the oncoming Trollocs, wrapped in the void. Rand fights the Trollocs and \"he fought as if a heron-mark blade could keep saidin from him\". After a while, Rand follows Loial back to the campsite and lets go of the void. There, they meet up with Selene and Hurin.\nSelene wants to look at the horn and so opens the chest. She sees the inscription of \"Tia mi aven Moridin isainde vadin\" and translates it to \"The grave is no bar to my call\" and so we know that she can speak the Old Tongue. Rand wants to turn back and take the Horn to Shienar but Selene convinces him to go onwards, \"You cannot go back, now. You are committed\". They decide to head for the safety of Cairhien to wait for Ingtar. Rand also shows the group Mat's dagger and Selene wants to throw the dagger away because of the danger it brings. Rand refuses, as he knows that Mat will die \"without it to use in Healing him\". The group prepare to leave, despite Selene's protests that she wants \"to finish what is left of my night's sleep\"."

Rand refuses because he is afraid of the dagger that is stored in the chest along with the Horn. Selene tries to convince Rand to get rid of the dagger but Rand remains strong. Since \"Aes Sedai (are) trying to make me do what they want\", he once more asks Selene if she is Aes Sedai because of that resemblance. Once more Selene becomes angry at the suggestion, \"Aes Sedai! Always you hurl that at me!\", and refuses to talk to Rand and \"wrapped herself in a silent coldness\".\nThe group set up camp for the night and Selene appears \"to have regained some of her temper\" as she talks with Loial and Hurin, though rarely to Rand. However, \"whenever he looked at her, she was watching him and smiling\".\nAt the end of the next day, they see \"the village ahead, lights already twinkling\" and Rand suggests that they sleep in the village inn. Loial and Hurin agree with Rand but Selene wants to sleep under the stars instead of in Tremonsien. Rand argues that she won't enjoy it if Fain and the Trollocs surprise them but Selene argues that \"If Fain catches us, you will deal with him\". She also says that they will be in danger if the villagers discover that Rand has the Horn and this time, Loial agrees with her. Rand's solution is to throw a blanket over the chest and it becomes \"my Lady's chest of clothes\".\nWhen they start riding again, Rand spots \"something very large, by the light it threw up\" and rides over to see what it is. He finds a very large pit with armored men apparently guarding the site. He sees \"a gigantic hand holding a crystal sphere\" which is apparently attached to the statue of a man whose face \"thrust out of the soil with the dignity of vast years\". This reminds him of the \"giant hand holding a huge crystal sphere\" on the island of Tremalking that Bayle Domon told him about.\nRand summons the void unconsciously as \"saidin sang to him\". In the crystal he sees light that swirls like saidin and the sphere pulses. Selene warns him to get away from the edge of the cliff but Rand pays no notice to her, intent on the calling of saidin. Although he tries to let go of the void, it stays in place. Rand then begins to mumble something; \"Till shade is gone... till water is gone... into the Shadow with teeth bared... to spit in Sightblinder's eye... on the last day\". The cliff he is standing on crumbles beneath his feet and he scrambles on to safe ground, trance broken. The others didn't hear what he said but urge him to leave quickly since \"those guards have finally noticed us\".\nThey ride into the village of Tremonsien and find the inn, called The Nine Rings and decide to stay there. Selene seems unsettled and admits that \"You terrified me... and I do not frighten easily\", referring to Rand's trance by the statue. Once more she talks of the glory of the Horn but once more, Rand protests that \"The Horn is not mine\". Upset with that answer, Selene \"turned her back on him, her white cloak walling him off\"."

Even if the words are different from the ones he knows.\nThe captain of the company, Aldrin Caldevwin, gestures to his men to shut up and joins Rand's company at his table. He apologizes for his men but Rand says he didn't mind in the least. Like the innkeeper the captain is puzzled by Rand's company. He notices Rand's heron-marked blade instantly. When Rand tells him he is from Andor the captain makes a false statement about Gareth Bryne to check this. Selene doesn't seem to be too happy by the attention Rand is attracting and goes up to her room. Again she surprises the innkeeper by asking for a room for herself.\nAfter Selene leaves the conversation between Rand and the captain continues. Rand asks about the crystal sphere they saw on their way to the inn. The captain says it is part of a statue left over from the Age of Legends his men are excavating on the King's orders. The captain wants to know how long they will be staying. Rand answers they will leave in the morning. The captain offers to escort them to Cairhien since he is heading that way as well. Rand accepts and the captain retires for the night.\nRand's company decides to follow the captain's example. When Rand tells the innkeeper he will be sharing a room with Loial and Hurin she tells him whatever trouble he is having with his lady, it will certainly look better in the morning. Rand is so surprised by this he doesn't correct the innkeeper.\nAfter the innkeeper leaves them Rand, Loial and Hurin discuss captain Caldevwin's behaviour for a bit. Hurin explains that in Cairhien everybody plays the great game or Daes Dae'mar in the Old Tongue. Hurin doesn't seem to know a lot about it and Loial claims not to understand the ways of humans.\nWhen they get up in the morning Selene is gone. She left Rand a note saying there were too many people around and that she will find him again in Cairhien. Fifty Cairhien soldiers await them outside, ready for the trip to the capital. The captain is very surprised to hear Selene already left. Hurin whispers in Rand's ear he had the inn watched and the captain's men didn't see her leave. The company rides for the city of Cairhien."

              "pov_summary": "Moiraine is sitting at a table full of books scrolls and manuscripts in the house of the twin Aes Sedai Vandene and Aldeleas in Arafel. She is looking for pieces of the puzzle surrounding Rand but she's not making any progress. Frustrated with her lack of progress she turns to her Warder and another problem she must deal with. They talk briefly about how they met and how they got to be bonded. Moiraine asks him if, after all these years, his bond chafes. Not really knowing where Moiraine wants to take this conversation Lan tells her that he accepts the bond without reservations still.\nMoiraine now tells him she has made arrangements so that in the event of her death the bond will pass to another Aes Sedai, Myrelle of the Green Ajah. He will feel compelled to seek her out. Lan is upset by this, this is the first time Moiraine has felt the need to use the Bond to compel Lan to do anything. He feels he is being treated as a pet, or worse still a package to be handed over to whomever he will fit best with. Despite Lan's anger Moiraine refuses to undo it though, she can hand him over to any sister she wishes and there is nothing he can do about it.\nInstead she returns to the original question. Does the bond not chafe? Lan gets even more upset now. He wants to know if this is all some kind of test to see if he is loyal. Not a test, Moiraine replies, but after events in Fal Dara she does wonder where his loyalties lie. Lan takes this to be a reference to Nynaeve. To keep him off balance Moiraine moves to an unexpected topic. Why did Lan tell Rand how to behave towards the Amyrlin? Lan doesn't really have a good answer. He suggests it may be the fact that Rand is a ta'veren. Moiraine can't deny that possibility. She dismisses a still very angry Lan so she can be alone to think.\nMoiraine thinks about the changes in Lan that Nynaeve caused. She notices he is starting to share some of her loyalties and objectives and wonders if Lan will be quite so willing to risk his life in the future. Putting the matter aside for the moment she returns to her studies.\nVandene comes in with a pot of tea for Moiraine since her Warder is practicing with his sword. Apparently Lan's presence has reminded Jaem that he is more than a gardener and handyman. The two Aes Sedai talk for a bit about Moiraine's studies. Moiraine asks Vandene some questions about several topics she has been looking at. Is there a connection between the Horn and the Dragon Reborn other than that the Horn must be found before the Final Battle? Vandene tells her there is none. Is there a link between the Dragon and Toman Head. Vandene and her sister have different ideas on that. Vandene seems to think the Dragon Reborn will appear somewhere above Toman Head based on a questionable translation from the Old Tongue. Her sister Aldeleas disagrees. Moiraine jumps to Shadar Logoth and Lanfear but Vandene can't offer her any useful information on either topic.\nAfter some speculation on the Dragon Reborn, Vandene has noticed the signs, she leaves Moiraine. The Blue sister decides to go for a walk in the garden to escape from all the unanswered questions. She hears someone behind her in the garden but assumes it is Lan. Too late she realizes she is being followed by a Draghkar, Shadowspawn that will suck the soul out of its victim. Unable to reach for saidar, Moiraine is defenceless against the creature. Then Lan and Jaem show up and kill the creature with their swords. The death cry of the Draghkar wakes up the whole village. In no time Vandene and Aldeleas are outside with lanterns. Aldeleas quickly sends Jaem to tell the villagers they don't know what made the noise but that they are all right while the others dispose of the body. The Aes Sedai wondered how it got so close undetected and Moiraine realizes the creature must have been shielded. A Black sister must have been involved. It's time for her and Lan to leave."

              "pov_summary": "Nynaeve is waiting in a room beneath the White Tower to take the Accepted test. She is slightly irritated at first having to wait for no apparent reason and now being rushed. The Mistress of Novices has explained to her what she should know for the test. In the room a big ter'angreal, a remnant of the Age of Legends is glowing faintly in the dark. The ter'angreal is shaped like three big arches and seems to be made out of one piece. Nynaeve must walk through the arches three times and face her fears. She will remember very little of her life in the real world. Once for what was, once for what is and once for what will be. Falter along the way and she will be put out of the Tower.\nNynaeve is also told that some people don't come back. They just disappeared after the ter'angreal was quieted down. Informed of the task she must perform and the risks attached Sheriam asks her for the last time if she is ready to take the test. She is allowed to refuse three times without being put out of the Tower. Thinking of how Moiraine turned the lives of Egwene, Rand, Perrin and Mat upside down she steels herself and proclaims she is ready.\n\"The way back will come but once, be steadfast.\" With those last words of advice Nynaeve steps through the arch. She finds herself, naked as the day she was born, in a strange sort of labyrinth. Obviously she is not going to find the exit by standing there so she starts walking. There is no indication of where the exit might be and Nynaeve gets frustrated by her lack of progress. Then she sees something moving from the corner of her eye. When she turns around there is nothing but she sees movement somewhere else now. She is convinced someone is following her and starts running. Then a very old-looking man steps out of the next corridor in front of her. He is Aginor, one of the Forsaken. Nynaeve becomes acutely aware of her nakedness when he says he'll enjoy her. She tries to run away again but Aginor follows her. Nynaeve now gets very angry and reaches for the source. She calls lighting down on a very surprised Aginor. He responds in kind but he is no match for Nynaeve's anger. She feels his resistance is weakening. Then the arch appears. The way back comes only once. Very frustrated she lets the Forsaken go and steps in to the arch.\nMemories come crashing back into Nynaeve as she steps through the arch. A relieved Sheriam takes her through the next step of the ritual. Nynaeve demands to know if what she's experienced inside the ter'angreal is real but Sheriam can't answer that question. She is very surprised to learn Nynaeve could channel inside the ter'angreal. Most people don't remember they can in the first place and it is a dangerous thing to do. Nynaeve is warned not to do it again.\nWhen Nynaeve steps in to the arch for a second time she finds herself in the Two Rivers. It's not the village she left behind though, she sees traces of neglect everywhere. Determined to have a word about this with the Mayor Bran al'Vere she sets out to the Winespring Inn. On the way she meets Cenn Buie who is even more unpleasant than usual towards her. Arriving at the inn she meets Marin al'Vere. She looks years older than Nynaeve remembers her. Marin wants to know if she brought Egwene back. Nynaeve can't exactly remember where Egwene is, but she knows the girl isn't with her. Marin tells her about the state of the village. The new Wisdom, Malena, turned out to be a bully. She is not afraid to use poison to kill people or driving people to suicide to get her way. Marin accuses the new Wisdom of murdering her husband, among other things, and bullying the men into electing Cenn in his stead. The village lives in fear of her. A furious Nynaeve sets out to confront the new Wisdom but when she leaves the inn the arch appears. Nynaeve is torn between helping her village and Marin, who begs not to leave her alone, and returning to the Tower. She chooses the Tower and steps through the arch.\nA crying Nynaeve again demands to know if what she has seen is real, knowing she will not get an answer. Sheriam is sympathetic but also tells her the third time is worst of all. Stopping now would mean being put out of the Tower, Nynaeve has no choice but to go on.\nStepping through the third arch she finds herself in Malkier. Lan is with her but she feels something is not right. A confused Lan asks if everything is well with his Queen and the mother of his children. Nynaeve can't bear this last test and wants to leave immediately. Lan is seriously worried of th about her now. He asks her where she wants to go. Finally Nynaeve sees the arch and sets out for it. Lan follows her. For a moment she is tempted to stay but telling a very upset Lan all of it is not real she steps through the arch. Lan calls after her. \"Please don't leave.\"\nAgain Nynaeve is in tears. She proclaims she hates all Aes Sedai. Sheriam tells her this is a quite common response for women who just passed the Accepted test. Examining Nynaeve's hands, she finds two long black thorns driven through her palms. Healing will not remove all the scars even though, according to Sheriam, it should have. Nynaeve now notices that the Amyrlin has arrived to complete the ritual. She is now Nynaeve al'Meara, Accepted of the White Tower."

When they get there Egwene is told to be there at this time every day from now on. When Egwene goes in she sees a young woman in novice white. She introduces herself as Elayne and tells Egwene she has been assigned to show her around. Egwene immediately notices the air of dignity and self-possession about her.\nThe girls talk a bit about their training and channeling men. Egwene shows Elayne that she already learned some things. When Elayne embraces the Source, Egwene sees the glow around a channeling woman for the first time. Then Elayne takes the conversation to Rand and Egwene finally realizes that she is the Daughter-Heir of Andor and that Rand didn't make the story about meeting her up. The Mistress of Novices told Elayne not the mention that and the conversation turns to Sheriam for a bit. Elayne takes them back to Rand a bit later though and Egwene feels a stab of jealousy at that. She tells Elayne the last time she has seen him he was in the company of a group of Shienaran soldiers. Elayne tells Egwene her mother's Aes Sedai advisor, Elaida of the Red Ajah, was very interested in him and is still looking for him. Egwene is alarmed at this news, a Red looking for a man who can channel! Elayne assures her that she wouldn't tell Elaida even if she knew where he was.\nThere are two other girls in the Tower who have met Rand. Egwene thinks that Rand is meeting a lot of girls on the road lately. Elayne takes her to meet one of them. On the way they meet the gentled false Dragon Logain accompanied by a couple of Accepted. He is a sorry sight and Egwene hopes Rand won't end up like that. The girl Elayne wants Egwene to meet turns out to be Min. Egwene remembers her from their brief stay in Baerlon. It turns out Min was 'invited' to come to the White Tower so the Aes Sedai could study her talent. Min sees images around people of things in their future. It turns out it doesn't have anything to do with the One Power. She sees a white flame around Egwene, for instance, but doesn't know what it means.\nBefore they can discuss Min's viewings further, Gawyn and Galad, Elayne's brothers, join the conversation. They are training with the Warders while Elayne is in the White Tower. Egwene thinks Galad is very beautiful and Min, Elayne and Gawyn watch somewhat amused as Galad asks her if he can meet her again if their duties allow it. Egwene manages a 'that would be nice\" before he departs. Elayne is not impressed with her brother at all, much to Gawyn's amusement. Although he agrees that Galad takes being good just a bit too far.\nElayne tells Gawyn that Egwene is from the same village as Rand. Gawyn thinks Rand is a very unusual man. He manages to touch people's lives so much that Gawyn almost thinks he is a ta'veren. He has also noted Elaida's interest in Rand. At that point Egwene decides she needs some friends in the Tower and that Min and Elayne would do wonderfully. A surprised Gawyn watches as the three girls hug each other. Min doesn't know what most of her viewings mean but she is sure the three of them are tied to each other somehow.\nGawyn spots Elaida coming their way. He thinks this is a good moment to leave. Elayne tries to introduce Egwene to her but Elaida reminds Elayne that they are not at her Mother's court and that she is not to speak unless spoken to. She dismisses Egwene and Elayne and tells Elayne to visit Sheriam for punishment. She wants to talk to Min alone."

From a distance they can see the strict layout of the city, the city walls forming a perfect square. Within the city walls towers rise up in a strictly ordered grid. Rand can see the famous Topless Towers of Cairhien from the distance. Outside the city walls the Foregate stretches out.\nThe soldiers clear a way for them as they move through the Foregate. Hurin explains to Rand that most of the people living there moved away from their farms near the Dragonwall during the Aiel War, a subject the Cairhienin are still very sensitive about. They didn't move back when the war ended leaving the city with a huge new population they couldn't accommodate within the city walls and the country with a severe shortage of grain. This is still being imported from the south in large quantities. To keep the population of the Foregate happy the King provides entertainment for free.\nWhen they get to the gate a clerk writes down Rand's name in a ledger and tells them they have to come back the next day to tell him the name of the inn where they are staying. Rand inquires after Selene but at the gate they haven't seen her but they'll keep an eye out for her. Even here the Great Game is being played and it makes Rand uncomfortable.\nTavolin and the soldiers leave them and Hurin takes them to an inn named the Defender of the Dragonwall he remembers from previous visits to Cairhien. The innkeeper is startled at Rand's appearance at first, taking him for an Aiel but as soon as he notices Rand's fine clothes he recovers. They take two rooms with a connecting door. When they have settled in Rand decides to go back to the Foregate for a bit. Loial doesn't want to go, he's afraid of meeting other Ogier, and Hurin settles for a drink in the common room.\nWhen Rand and Hurin go down three invitations from noble Houses have arrived for him. Rand refuses to play Daes Dae'mar and throws them in the fire while proclaiming this to the visitors of the inn. Hurin winces and tries to explain to Rand this will obviously have undesirable effects. A still angry Rand walks out of the inn in the direction of the Foregate.\nIn the Foregate he sees lots of entertainment in the streets and inns. The Great Hunt of the Horn is recited in many places. It reminds him uncomfortably of Thom. Then he hears a familiar voice retelling a tale from the Hunt of the Horn. Rand moves closer to the dais and sees Thom performing. Thom recognizes him and gestures to a door. Rand goes to meet him in a corridor behind the dais. Thom tells him the Fade wasn't all that interested in him and left him wounded instead of killed. He still limps because of it. He also wants to know if Rand still has his harp and flute. Thom has to go back on stage again so there isn't much time to talk. He tells Rand the name of the inn he is staying in and says he'll be there in an hour. He also tells him to bring his instruments."

Loial wants to meet him but when Rand suggests that they go and see Thom, his enthusiasm decreases, \"I really would rather stay here\". This is because of the rumours of Ogier in Cairhien and Loial thinks that he will be in trouble if they find him. Rand convinces Loial to go, \"Loial, you can't stay cooped up in here forever\", and they leave Hurin guarding the Horn.\nRand and Loial go to The Bunch of Grapes, where Thom is staying, and the innkeeper, Zera, tells them to go up to his room to wait. In Thom's room they find a woman called Dena who is Thom's lover. Rand tells her that \"I've brought Thom back his harp and his flute\", adding that they are there to visit him as well. They learn that Dena is Thom's \"apprentice\" and that she will be the first female gleeman.\nThom comes back to the inn, complaining about \"that lack-wit Seaghan\" and the \"pack of louts who call themselves 'players'\". Thom sends Dena away on the pretence of collecting her knives, \"Why don't you go pay Ivon for them?\", so he can talk to Rand and Loial. Thom tells them that when he went to Caemlyn \"Basel Gill told me you left in the company with an Ogier\". He goes on to tell them that Dena will not become a gleeman but a \"Court-bard to a king or a queen\" since being a gleeman is \"no life for a woman\". Rand then gives Thom back his harp and his flute.\nRand then tells Thom that they have the Horn of Valere though Thom doesn't believe them, \"I can take you to three men who will sell you the Horn\". Thom's laughter is cut short when Rand tells him that \"Moiraine says it's the Horn\"; Thom doesn't want to be caught up with Aes Sedai again. Rand hastily assures him that Aes Sedai do not accompany them. Thom admits that \"at least you have sense enough to keep it secret\". Rand then tells him that they want to take the Horn back to Fal Dara and asks Thom to accompany them, \"you know things I can't even imagine\". Thom refuses to go with them and Rand asks Loial to leave them alone.\nRand then asks Thom of The Karaethon Cycle, The Prophecies of the Dragon, and Thom repeats two sections of the Cycle to him:\nWhen Rand hears the part about the heron mark, he hides his hand but \"he could feel it... he knew it was there\". Thom warns Rand once more that going along with Aes Sedai would mean trouble, \"dying somewhere in the Blasted Lands is a high price to pay\". Rand once more denies any connection with the White Tower. Thom is curious about why Rand asked him and Rand says that he was curious, having learned many things about the Horn of Valere; including the fact that the dead heroes will \"come for whoever blows the Horn, even a Darkfriend\".\nThom talks about his nephew that could channel and the fact that \"the Red Ajah never gave him a chance\". Owyn was gentled and gave up the will to live, something that has caused Thom to mistrust the White Tower, especially the Red Ajah. Rand then asks Thom to accompany them again but he refuses, saying that \"I will not get mixed up in it again\". Rand leaves as Thom advises \"a clean break\" but he gives Rand the flute, \"you might need to earn your supper again\".\nAfter Rand has left, Zera comes up to Thom's room to warn him against playing Daes Dae'mar, The Game of Houses, again; \"The Game has grown dangerous in Cairhien\". Zera is annoyed that Thom appears to be playing the Game again, despite Thom's protests that he is not, and advises him to marry Dena and forget about Daes Dae'mar. When she leaves, Thom thinks of Rand and how he \"was still only a shepherd\" and how \"he is out of it... and so am I\"."

Rand begins to think about the Horn and how \"Fain will come sooner or later\". Before this trail of thought finishes, a Trolloc and a group of Darkfriends attack them. Rand summons the void and kills the Trolloc using \"The Moon Rises Over the Lakes\", and the Darkfriends flee.\nRand's first thought is to return to the inn, \"Hurin's alone\", but a Trolloc sneaks up on him and tries to strangle him. Loial grabs the Trolloc and they wrestle, \"Loial had it by wrist and forearm\", but Rand cannot kill it through the fear of hurting Loial. Rand summons the void in an attempt to channel saidin but cannot reach it, \"there was only the taint\". Whilst Rand tries to channel, Loial \"threw the Trolloc aside\", thus breaking its neck and killing it. This is the first time Loial has killed anything and he is horrified, \"But I cannot like it. Even a Trolloc\".\nThe pair see a group of performers with what is supposed to be a puppet of a Trolloc. It is in fact a real Trolloc, \"the 'puppet' moved its legs too naturally\". Rand realizes that Fain knows they are in Cairhien but \"he is afraid of the Trollocs being seen\". They realize that being in a crowded place is best as the Trollocs won't strike but \"every time Rand tried to reach the music and laughter, there was a Trollocs in the way\". They are forced eastwards through the Foregate until they reach the edge of the city. They know that if they set foot out of Cairhien, the Trollocs will be free to act.\nRand sees what he thinks is \"a lord's manor\" but Loial identifies it as an Illuminators' chapter house. Loial warns Rand that the Illuminators are very secretive and \"I don't think they would let Galldrian himself inside\". At that moment, Selene steps out from around the corner and berates him for \"allowing Trollocs to herd you like sheep\". Rand wraps his cloak around her to dull the shimmer of her white dress, which could give them away. As the Trollocs move closer, still looking for them. Selene spots a door leading in to the chapter house and they take the chance to enter, despite Loial's protests.\nOnce they are inside Loial voices his protests, \"I have heard the Illuminators kill intruders\", but they cannot go back. They hide in the shadows while two Illuminators, Tammuz and Aludra, walk past, talking about a display. Once they are gone, the group walk through the chapter house looking for an exit. Rand is unnerved by the fact that Loial \"crept along in a cloud of clatters and mutterings\" while Selene makes no attempt \"to keep the cloak closed\" as it would hide the glow of her dress.\nLoial knocks over a stand filled with \"ten soft looking sticks\" and causes some fireworks to explode. The group hide in the shadows while Illuminators try to save some of the fireworks. Aludra, apparently in charge of the display, blames Tammuz for the accident, \"You great buffoon, Tammuz!\", and punishes him accordingly, \"you will leave with the carts to buy the manure\".\nWhen the Illuminators go away, Loial notices three Trollocs, blocking their way to freedom, and an Illuminator staring into the room. If they moved, \"it would become a race as to whether the Trollocs or Illuminators reached them first\". Rand sends Loial and Selene off to the way out while he stops the Trollocs. Rand doesn't use the void or channel saidin; instead he points a firework at the Trollocs and lights the fuse. This kills the Trollocs and sets fire to the chapter house. Rand joins Loial in the alleyway, free of Trollocs, but Selene has gone back in to the chapter house. Loial convinces Rand that he can do nothing, \"You cannot help her\", and the pair return to their inn.\nThere is a letter for Rand, with a white seal of \"a crescent moon and stars\", that has been written by Selene. She accuses Rand of \"being a dangerous man\" but also says that \"you are always mine\". The chapter ends with Rand wishing that \"Ingtar would come\"."

              "pov_summary": "The group are still riding after Fain and the Trollocs and are now riding through the mountains of Kinslayer's Dagger. Perrin knows that \"there were people in the mountains\" because the wolves have told him. He also knows that the Trollocs are still ahead, even \"though Ingtar had pressed the column hard\". Mat is looking paler than ever; Verin's Healing not making any noticeable difference. Perrin also notices that Verin \"always rode at the head of the column with Ingtar\" and through her behaviour, he knows that \"Somehow, she knows about Rand\". Perrin is able to see images through the wolves of \"stone farmhouses and terraced villages\".\nIngtar talks to Perrin about the message from the wolves again, \"I've told you ten times\". Perrin tells of an attack on Fain and the Darkfriends by someone the wolves call \"Shadowkiller\". The wolves aren't \"afraid of this Shadowkiller; awe is more like it\". Shadowkiller is now being followed by Fain and the Trollocs and from this information, we can tell that Rand is \"Shadowkiller\". Perrin and the group do not know this and Ingtar thinks that Shadowkiller may be \"something of the Dark One, like a Myrddraal\".\nPerrin and Ingtar's conversation is interrupted by Uno who has seen an \"Aielman in the rocks\". Ingtar is surprised that the Aiel are so far away from the Waste, knowing that there is more than one because \"when you see one bloody Aiel, there's always more you don't\". Apparently the Aiel must have wanted to be seen \"or I likely wouldn't have\". The Aiel is not veiled so Uno knows that he is not there to fight. The Aielman comes down on to the road and Ingtar has to stop some soldiers from killing him, \"I'll have the ears of any man who doesn't stop\".\nPerrin sees that the Aielman dresses in clothes that \"would blend into rock or earth\" and he is armed with a bow, a quiver of arrows, a knife, a buckler and \"three short spears, no more than half as long as he was tall\". The Aielman is called \"Urien, of the Two Spires sept of the Reyn Aiel\", and is \"a Red Shield\". Ingtar, Perrin and Mat dismount and join him to talk. Perrin and Mat notice the physical similarities between Urien and Rand and begin to understand why Ingtar thinks Rand is Aiel.\nWhen Ingtar tells Urien that \"we, at least, are here for other things than fighting\", Urien appears disappointed, showing how the Aiel are very willing to fight. Urien then addresses Verin as \"Wise One\" although he does not mistake her for Aiel. Apparently she has \"the look of those who have made the journey to Rhuidean and survived\". Ingtar interrupts this train of thought by asking if Urien has seen any Trollocs. Urien grows excited at the mention of Trollocs south of the Blight because he tells them \"When the Trollocs come out of the Blight again, we will leave the Three-fold Land and take back our places of old\". The Three-fold Land is also called the Waste, \"a shaping stone, to make us; a testing ground, to prove out worth; and a punishment for the sin\". Apparently the sin is so old that only the Wise Ones and the Clan Chiefs know what it is.\nVerin asks Urien what Rhuidean is and he is very reluctant to tell her. He says that \"Rhuidean lies in the lands of the Jenn Aiel, the thirteenth clan\" and that the only people who are allowed to go there are those wishing to become Clan Chiefs or Wise Ones. Verin appears slightly unsatisfied with his answer and Urien asks, \"Will you slay me now, Aes Sedai?\" He tells them that \"One of the old prophecies says that if we ever fail the Aes Sedai again, they will slay us\". Urien is unfazed by his apparent imminent death, \"Bring your lightnings, Aes Sedai\", but Verin reassures him that she won't kill him. Urien seems astounded when Verin suggests that he might harm her; \"How could I strike at a woman who has not wedded the spear?\"\nUrien tells them that some Aiel have left the Waste to search for \"He Who Comes With the Dawn\". \"It is said there will be great signs and portents of his coming\". He doesn't know what these signs will be but he says that \"He will come from the west, beyond the Spine of the World, but be of our blood. He will go to Rhuidean, and lead us out of the Three-Fold Land\". He then draws \"the ancient symbol of the Aes Sedai\" and tells them that \"under this sign, he will conquer\". Urien then leaves to continue his search.\nThe group then mounts again and set off again. Perrin and Mat talk about Urien and discuss the possibility that Rand could be \"He Who Comes With the Dawn\". Verin is impatient for them to get going after she mutters, \"does the Dark One touch the Pattern again?\""

The sight of a \"long gibbet marring the village green\" from which thirty bodies hang greets him. His asks Muadh who's work it is and he replies that the villagers describe a man \"that sounds twin to Child Earwin\" and a man that \"sounds almost like Child Wuan\". Bornhald identifies them as Questioners but can do nothing about it since \"his orders had been explicit: Obey the Questioners\". He orders the dead to be cut down and for Muadh to \"make sure the villagers know there will be no more killing\". Bornhald then orders Muadh to \"pick one out for me\" so that he can find out what happened.\nBornhald thinks of the invaders he has heard of all over the Almoth Plain. They are called the Seanchan, the Rhyagelle, Those Who Come Home, or Hailene, Those Who Come Before. They \"spoke of Corenne, The Return\", and how many people think that they are Artur Hawkwing's armies returned from over the seas. Bornhald doesn't know where the Seanchan come from and \"requests for information from the Sea Folk had been met with silence\". Survivors of the Seanchan invasion had spoken \"of men who came in to battle riding monsters (...) and brought Aes Sedai to rend the earth\".\nByar interrupts Bornhald's train of thought by announcing that \"Child Jeral has just ridden in with a message\". The message is from \"Jaichim Carridin who guides the Hand of the Light\" who commands that Bornhald stop his advance on Falme and concentrate on rooting out Darkfriends on the Almoth Plain. Bornhald disagrees with the orders as he has \"seen nothing in any village he has ordered taken\" except farmers and craftsmen. Bornhald is critical of the Questioners' plan because he thinks that the Darkfriends \"are in Falme, not on the plain\". He tells Byar that he means \"to take the legion onto Toman Head\". A prisoner of the village is then brought in to explain what happened in the village."

              "pov_summary": "Domon is sailing on the Spray near Toman Head and is being followed by another ship that turns out to belong to the Seanchan. He orders the helmsman to \"take her closer in\" since \"that ship will no dare enter the shallow waters\". He thinks of the reports he has of the Seanchan; how villagers \"were rent by lightning from the sky (...) and the earth erupted in fire\". At first he was sceptical but after he saw the blackened ground in many villages, he began to believe it. The people in Tanchico had believed that their army would take care of it but the people in the coastal towns didn't.\n\"The Seanchan told astonished people they must swear again oaths\" and young women were examined and some of them were taken away. \"New mayors were chosen by the Seanchan\" so that they could control the villages and those who protested were gotten rid of. Once people had sworn \"to obey the Forerunners, await the Return, and serve Those Who Come Home\", the Seanchan left and didn't usually return. Most villages remained as the Seanchan left them, too afraid to return to their old councils.\nWhile they try to reach safer waters, \"the surface of the sea broke into fountaining water and flame\". Realizing that this was a threat that could destroy the ship, Domon orders for the ship to slow down so the Seanchan can catch up. The Seanchan lower a boat and move several people onto the Spray. The first to climb aboard is a woman dressed in armor, which is strange enough. The woman first checks that no women are present on the ship, there aren't, and then two women climb aboard, \"one drawing the other by a leash of silvery metal\". The woman, called Captain Egeanin, catches him looking at the women and tells him that the leashed woman is damane and seems proud that she owns one. Domon mistakenly calls her Aes Sedai and Egeanin is displeased about that, \"They are only damane, the Leashed Ones\".\nEgeanin orders that the Spray be sailed to Falme and the Seanchan sail back to their ship, leaving only one man aboard, called Caban. Caban has considerable contempt \"for anyone this side of the Aryth Ocean\" and Domon wonders if the stories of Artur Hawkwing's lost armies are true. He also finds out from Caban that damane are \"the business of the Blood\". In the harbor of Falme, Domon sees more ships in one place than before and he is astounded. Domon looks away from anything too much to do with the Seanchan, \"I do be a trader, and it is none of my business\".\nThe crew of the Spray are taken off the boat while it is searched by soldiers and the damane, this time collared by a different woman. Whilst the search occurs, a creature appears that has \"a leathery, grey-green hide and a beak of a mouth in a wedge-shaped head\". Once the search is finished, Egeanin walks off the boat, carrying something small wrapped in silk and takes Domon to a hall. On the way, Domon notices that some people who are not Seanchan are allowed to carry weapons and Egeanin explains that there is no reason to stop them if they obey their oaths. Soldiers riding by ride \"creatures that looked almost like cats the size of horses, but with lizards' scales\".\nEgeanin leads him to a guarded hall, where she \"surrendered her sword and dagger\" and then leads him inside. When two men enter the room, Egeanin \"dropped to her knees\" and then \"prostrated herself with her hands at her sides\" and Domon follows her example. Once of the men is introduced as \"the High Lord Turak (...) who leads Those Who Come Before, and succors the Return\". Egeanin presents the silk wrapped object to the High Lord Turak who seems to be pleased with it, \"this is a fine specimen\". He tells Egeanin that \"I will mention your name to the Empress\" which is apparently a very great honor. She then leaves the room.\nTurak is holding the cuendillar seal of the Aes Sedai shape that Domon used to own. Turak seems interested as to how Domon found the seal and shows him other cuendillar objects that he owns, \"enough to buy a kingdom\". Domon tries to give the seal as a gift but apparently Egeanin already has and so the unnamed lord considers it an insult, though Turak cuts him off. Turak tells Domon cannot let him go \"in this shadowed land of oath-breakers\", instead deciding to keep Domon so he can talk to him about his collection. Turak is brought a cup of kaf and asks Domon \"how a simple trader came to possess a piece\" of cuendillar. The chapter finishes with Domon trying \"to lie his way out of Falme\"."

              "pov_summary": "Rand thinks about the Illuminators' chapter house and how \"the Illuminators were on everyone's tongues\". He hopes that \"no one had been hurt in the fire\" but he cannot know for sure as the Illuminators hadn't even \"admitted that there had been a fire\". Rand turns his attention to Hurin and becomes irritated that he became \"more formal every day that they remained in Cairhien\". He is angry that Hurin now calls him \"my Lord\" and that he bows to Rand most of the time. When Rand shouts at him and then apologises, Hurin simply tells him \"It's your right, my Lord\".\nTheir conversation is interrupted when Cuale, the innkeeper, delivers two letters to Rand personally. These letters \"are from Lord Barthanes, High Seat of House Damodred, and from (...) the King\". Each is sealed with the personal seal of the two men; Galldrian's Stag and Barthanes' Charging Boar. Rand's first instinct is to throw the letters into the fire like the rest but both Loial and Hurin object. Rand explains that if he goes to one, \"the Cairhienin will read something into it\". He will treat the letters as he has treated the others so he won't be \"for anyone in Cairhien\", nor against them.\nLoial and Hurin explain to him that it won't work like that; \"whatever you do, Cairhienin will see some sort of plot in it\". Hurin explains that the lesser Houses haven't acted further because they believe that \"you must have powerful allies to risk insulting them\". If Rand burns the two invitations, he will insult both the King and the second most powerful Lord in Cairhien and \"they'll act for sure\". Also, burning the letters will mean that he isn't allied with either the King or Barthanes and so the other Houses can act on his insult. According to Hurin, the \"Houses in Cairhien use killers, now\".\nLoial suggests that they go to both but Hurin explains that it wouldn't work, \"you don't know Daes Dae'mar\". The King and Barthanes are bitter enemies so if Rand accepts both, they will each see him as a spy for the other. If he only accepts one, he will certainly be a spy. Either way \"they'll use the knife and poison\". Rand suggests that he'll \"let them see me in the common room with these\", the seals unbroken. This way both Houses will know that he hasn't opened the letters and it'll hopefully buy them time.\nRand then does this and he and Loial go the gates to see if Ingtar has arrived, leaving Hurin to guard the Horn. Whilst they walk they try to find a way to escape, since \"this trick with the invitations can't work more than two or three days\". They agree that they can't ride out of the city, \"since Fain is out there\", and joining a merchant train won't work either. Darkfriends will be watching the docks so they can't leave through the Foregate docks and the city docks are \"reserved for grain barges and the pleasure craft of the lords and ladies\". Stedding Tsofu is near Cairhien but Fain wouldn't \"let us get that far without attacking\".\nWhen they arrive guardhouse at the edge of the city, Rand thinks that he saw \"a man dressed in what had once been good Shienaran clothes\" but he dismisses it when he can't see the man anymore. They enter the guardhouse and ask the guardsman if Ingtar or Selene have entered the city. Whilst they talk, Rand spots Caldevwin but the guardsman denies that he is there. He also denies that Ingtar or Selene have entered the city. Rand knows that the man is lying, \"he could be lying about all of it\", but he can't do anything about it so they return to the inn. When they near the inn, they see that \"there's a fire up ahead\".\nRand realises that although Trollocs cannot come into the city, Darkfriends can. They see Cuale \"directing men carrying furnishings\" but not Hurin. Cuale hasn't seen Hurin either, \"no doubt he went out\", but Rand and Loial know that Hurin wouldn't leave the Horn. Both Rand and Loial go into the burning inn to retrieve Hurin and the Horn despite warnings not to, \"You cannot go up there, my Lord\". They find that their room \"had not caught yet\" but see Hurin's sprawled body on the floor. Hurin is obviously injured, \"there was a lump on the side of his head\", and the Horn is gone. The Darkfriends that started the fire had obviously hit Hurin and taken the Horn during the confusion. Loial takes Hurin out onto the street but Rand goes to his room to retrieve the banner, \"Your life may depend on it. Aes Sedai never lie\".\nRand snatches up his saddlebags, including both the banner and Thom's flute, and \"threw himself back through the door\", seconds before the ceiling gave way. He then goes out onto the street and finds Loial and Hurin. Rand tries to find someone to help Hurin, \"a woman who knows herbs and healing\", but the Reader, apparently the Cairhienin equivalent to a Wisdom, tells Rand that \"something is broken inside his head\". They are interrupted by Perrin, Mat and Ingtar who have just arrived. Rand then tells them \"You came too late\" and begins to laugh."

Mat wants to know how they came to be in Cairhien but Rand and Loial are aware of the big crowd watching them, \"a few edged closer trying to listen\". Rand asks, \"How did you find the inn\", thinking that it was probably through Verin but Mat explains differently. When the group arrived at the guardhouse, a guard took their names but \"a fellow coming out of the guardhouse gave a jump when he heard Ingtar's name\". They knew he was lying immediately, \"he had a smile that shouted 'lie' a mile off\", and Verin was able to persuade him to tell them where Rand, Loial and Hurin were.\nApparently, Uno and the other soldiers are in the Foregate because \"they'd rather stay there than inside the walls\". Mat asks about the dagger and so Rand admits that \"I had the dagger, and I lost it\". He also admits that he lost the Horn, though not in so many words, and that Darkfriends took both objects. Mat tells Rand that Perrin is a sniffer too and that \"he followed the trail all the way to the Foregate\". When Rand looks at Perrin, he hears Perrin mutter 'Shadowkiller' and so it is obvious to us that Perrin now knows whom the wolves speak of. The surrounding crowd realizes that Verin is Aes Sedai and \"the words 'Aes Sedai' ran through the crowd\". Aware of the crowd, Rand suggests that they find a more private place to talk and Verin suggests the inn called The Great Tree.\nAs they ride to the inn, Rand asks Hurin if he can follow the trail of \"the men who hit you and started the fire\". Hurin can but \"it won't last long\" so he must follow it sooner rather than later. Loial suggests that the Darkfriends were unable to open the chest or \"they would just have taken the Horn\". Rand agrees and explains that the Darkfriends will soon join up with the Trollocs and so the trail will be easier to follow. He then suggests that Hurin should \"rest until you're fit\" and then \"if we ride hard\", they will be able to catch them. Rand then realizes that he is giving orders and apologizes to Ingtar, since Ingtar is supposed to be in charge, \"It's just that I've become used to being in charge\".\nThe group arrive at the inn and Tiedra, the innkeeper, shows them to their rooms. Rand gets washed and puts some clean clothes on since the ones he was wearing \"had black smears across the red wool\". Whilst looking through his coats, he finds Selene's letters and \"wondered how he could have been such a fool\". He thinks that \"if I could marry any woman, it would be Egwene\". He then sets fire to the letters and \"tossed the burning letters in to the cold hearth\", leaving the room shortly after to meet the others in a private dining room."

Verin wants to know \"how you vanished from Ingtar's camp without a trace\" and so he explains what happened; although in his story, Selene activated the Portal Stones. Perrin once more thinks of 'Shadowkiller' and unconsciously says it out loud, though only Rand could hear. Perrin \"found himself wanting to tell Rand about the wolves\" because he knows Rand's secret. On the other hand, Verin wants to meet Selene to find out more about the Portal Stones, \"even that name is not widely known\". Their meal is then served and Perrin has a craving for rare meat, \"not even cooked\". After the meal, they wait in the room for Hurin to return so they can decide what to do.\nWhen Hurin returns, he gives some very interesting news; \"I tracked them to their lair\". It appears that the Darkfriends have met up with the Trollocs in Cairhien and are hiding in a manor, \"the great manor Lord Barthanes has just finished building\". Ingtar doesn't want to believe this but Verin explains \"the mighty give their souls to the Shadow as often as the weak\". Hurin explains that the best way to get in is if as few people as possible go, \"a hundred could do it, but two would be better\". Mat suggests that they tell the King that Barthanes is a Darkfriend since Barthanes and Galldrian are enemies. Verin explains that if they tell the King, \"Galldrian would never let the Horn of Valere out of his grasp\" and so their quest would be pointless. Ingtar elaborates and says that \"if we tried to leave with the Horn, he'd cut our honoured heads off\".\nVerin suggests that she'll \"let slip to Tiedra that I would like to see Barthanes' new manor, I should have an invitation in a day or two\". Hurin points out that it is unnecessary because Rand already has an invitation. Ingtar is shocked that Rand has the invitation, \"what have you been doing?\", and Rand explains that \"they just sent them to me\". Verin burns the King's letter but Rand is not convinced that he can play the part of a lord, \"they will know I'm no lord\". Verin tells him that he can do it, \"people see what they expect to see\", and Rand reluctantly agrees.\nThey decide to go to Barthanes' manor the next day though Ingtar is angry that they must wait, \"the Horn could be fifty miles downriver\". He also explains that \"Cairhienin are very strict in their protocol\" and so if Rand doesn't write a letter of acceptance, Barthanes will be so offended that he will not let them in. However, if they do write a letter, \"well, Fain, at least, knows him\". Verin explains, \"We will surprise them\" and then asks Rand what Barthanes meant when he wrote that \"you took an interest in one of the King's projects\". Rand tells her about the statue from the Age of Legends that they saw on their way to Cairhien.\nVerin explains that the statue is actually a sa'angreal, \"one of a pair, the two largest ever made\". She says that the other is on the island of Tremalking and can only be used by a woman; a man can only use the one in Cairhien. Apparently, \"together, they might well be powerful enough to Break the World again\". Ingtar expresses concern that a man who could channel would find it but Verin is not too concerned. She explains that only people who are very strong in the Power could cope with channeling through these sa'angreal and therefore they must only worry when \"the real Dragon Reborn proclaims himself\". It is obvious that she is talking to Rand and Perrin hopes that the White Tower won't use Rand. The chapter ends with Perrin thinking, \"he did not think Rand knew half what he thought he did\"."

Rand was there for the invitation, Ingtar \"to lend the prestige of his title\", Loial being an Ogier was automatically sought after, Hurin would \"sniff out the Darkfriends\", Mat would be able to sense the dagger and Verin was there \"to keep the rest of you out of trouble\". Mat and Hurin were disguised as servants; however, Mat had to be convinced to be a servant, \"if Rand can be a lord, I can put on a fancy coat, too\".\nAfter introducing themselves very formally to the servants on the door, the group enter the manor and Ashin, another servant, shows them into \"a great room filled with nobles\". Rand notices that the nobles stand in very small groups dotted around the hall \"with careful space between so no one could overhear\", undoubtedly an effect of Daes Dae'mar. The Cairhienin nobles dress in dark colors with stripes of colors on the front of their chests, signifying rank and House. The women wear their hair \"piled high in elaborate towers of curls\" and the skirts of their dresses are impractically wide.\nWhen Ashin announces their names to the nobles, each person is greeted with murmurs and whisperings; Verin being an Aes Sedai, Loial being an Ogier and Rand and Ingtar carrying swords, especially Rand's heron-marked sword. Barthanes welcomes them to the party and speaks quickly to each member of the group, \"Perhaps we will have a chance to talk this night\", before rejoining his guests. The group mingle in the crowd of nobles but before Loial leaves Rand, he tells him, \"there is a Waygate near by. I can feel it\". Loial then joins the crowd and Rand is left alone.\nRand has to move quickly to avoid talking to the nobles, \"he turned in the other direction and hurried away\", but soon he is joined by Barthanes. The lord notices that he is avoiding the other nobles and after this Rand walks purposefully, Cat Crosses the Courtyard that Lan taught him, even though it seems to annoy Barthanes. Rand comments on the guests and Barthanes automatically sees it as part of Daes Dae'mar. Rand denies any connection with the King but Barthanes doesn't believe it, \"You just happened to be in that flyspeck village\", and assumes Rand was checking on the statue for Galldrian. Thinking back to what Verin had said, Rand warns him \"it's dangerous to meddle with things from the Age of Legends\". Thinking of this as part of Daes Dae'mar, Barthanes ignores this piece of information and tells Rand, \"I did not know Andormen played at the Great Game so well\".\nWhen Barthanes questions Rand about his heron-marked blade, his answer suggests to Barthanes that he is \"Borderland-trained. Or is it Warder-trained?\" He then questions Rand about Andor and his Aiel-like appearance, \"I have heard the Andoran royal line has almost Aiel colouring\". Rand denies any connection to either of them and Barthanes leaves him, \"You have given me much to think on\".\nWhile Rand walks amongst the nobles, he thinks of Daes Dae'mar and how \"he had no idea at all how it was played\" and that he wants to leave quickly. Whilst walking, Rand spots Thom \"reciting a tale from The Great Hunt of the Horn\". He stops to look but this proves to be a bad move as Alaine Chuliandred, a Cairhienin noble, promptly corners him. She asks him if he can play the flute and Rand remembers his conversation with Caldevwin in the Nine Rings, \"Light, everybody does hear everything in Cairhien\". She then gives him a veiled invitation to her house, \"I would like very much to hear you play\", while her husband is \"sampling his own vineyards\". Before Rand can refuse the invitation, another woman, Belevaere Osiellin, joins them. She gives Rand a less veiled invitation and Alaine immediately dismisses her as having \"the subtlety of a tavern wench\". Belevaere informs her that \"subtlety is but lack of courage\" and turns her attention back to Rand. He tries to leave again but yet another lady joins them; she is called Breane Taborwin. She gives him another invitation but Rand finally manages to get away from them under the pretense of talking to Thom.\nRand tells him of his problems; Daes Dae'mar, the Horn, Aes Sedai and the three women though he denies that he wants Thom's help, \"I just wanted to get away from those women\". He then tells Thom that Barthanes is a Darkfriend and Thom warns him that it's \"a dangerous thing to say\". He also warns Rand that he has let himself get entangled in the White Tower's manipulations. The conversation is cut short when Hurin comes to tell him \"your manservant had a fall\" and required Rand to follow him. This is obviously an excuse to leave the room to find the Horn. Rand follows Hurin out of the room, but not before Thom can warn him \"Cairhienin may play Daes Dae'mar, but it was the White Tower who made the Great Game\"."

              "pov_summary": "Hurin leads Rand \"down a cramped flight of stairs\" to a garden. Hurin has tracked the Darkfriends to that garden, where \"Trollocs joined them, went into the garden with them\". They haven't come out of the garden since they entered it yesterday and so they must still be there. While they walk down to the garden, Rand comments that he is glad that Hurin is \"talking to me naturally again\". Hurin tells him that though Cairhienin servants \"pretend to be so proper\", they are willing to share their secrets over mugs of ale. Hurin doesn't approve of this, \"I know they're Cairhienin, but I never heard of such goings on\". He also tells Rand that he didn't fetch Verin or Ingtar because Verin was talking to Barthanes and didn't want to be disturbed and Ingtar \"had let himself be cornered\" by several Cairhienin nobles.\nThey meet Loial and Mat in a passage and Loial tells him about the Ogier stonemasons; \"the reason all the Ogier stonemasons left is because Galldrian stopped paying them\". Mat tells him that he had no trouble leaving the other servants and that he hasn't sensed the dagger, \"the only thing I've sensed is that somebody's watching me\". Rand explains that since he \"put it in the chest with the Horn, maybe that keeps you from feeling it\". Hurin then leads them to the gardens and while they walk, Rand thinks of how Hurin won't be able to smell Darkfriends among Barthanes' servants. Hurin points out a walled enclosure in the garden and tells them that it is the place where the Trollocs went. Loial senses that the enclosure is built around a Waygate, \"I told you this was all an Ogier grove\". Mat seems discouraged that in all probability, the Trollocs have taken the Horn through the Ways, \"I just have enough brains not to want to travel the Ways again\". Rand then orders Mat to find Verin and Ingtar, \"I don't care how\", and tell them what they have found and so Mat leaves them.\nLoial gives Rand a boost up onto the top of the wall, where he drops on to the other side despite Loial's protests, \"Loial gave a low hsst and grabbed at his foot\". Hurin and Loial follow him into the garden, where Loial chastises Rand for his impulsiveness, \"you are going to get me in trouble\". Rand then walks up to the Waygate and tells a nervous Hurin that it is possible to travel the Ways, \"I've done it, and Loial, and Mat, and Perrin\". To prove this to Hurin, Rand takes \"the trefoil leaf of fabled Avendesora\", thus opening the Waygate.\nHowever, Machin Shin is waiting at the opening and they are able to hear the mutterings of the wind, \"blood so sweet, so sweet to drink the blood\". Through the mutterings, there is another whispering, \"Al'Thor. Al'Thor. Al'Thor\". Rand has dropped the leaf in shock and embraced the void and saidin. Without knowing what he is doing, Rand hurls a weave of the One Power into the Waygate and \"the Black Wind shrieked, ten thousand wordless howls\". Rand continues to embrace saidin until he sees the Waygate begin to close as Loial puts the leaf back on the gate. After that, Rand \"clawed his way out of the void\" and let go of saidin. Rand realises that they cannot follow Fain through the Ways and tells the others so. They then leave the walled garden and go to find the others.\nWhen they try to leave the manor, Barthanes joins them and pulls Rand to one side. He tells Rand that he has a message for him from a man who wasn't \"the sort for whom I would usually carry message\" and from his description, Rand knows that it was Fain. The message is that Fain has taken the Horn to Toman Head and that Rand must follow him there. If he doesn't, Fain will \"hound your blood, and your people\" until he does. Since the message doesn't actually mention the Horn, Barthanes wants\u200b to know what it is that Fain carries. Rand ignores the questions and bids him goodnight and leaves with the others.\nOnce they are back in the inn, Verin leads Rand, Loial, Ingtar and Mat to their private dining room where Perrin is already waiting. Once there, Rand and Loial explain what happened in the garden to the waiting group, \"Hurin followed them right to it\". When Rand explained that Machin Shin was standing guard, Verin explains that it can't be possible, \"no one can constrain the Black Wind to do anything\". Since no body knows what Machin Shin actually is, they cannot do anything to or with it. Ingtar believes that he has lost the Horn forever, \"The Horn is lost. I am lost\", but Rand contradicts him by explaining the message.\nIngtar believes it is a trick but Rand thinks that it is true and means \"to ride as hard as I can\" to get to Toman Head. Loial, Mat and Perrin agree to go with Rand, each for their own reasons. Ingtar wants to \"get Barthanes alone\" and force him to say where the Horn has gone. Verin thinks back to the writing on the wall in Fal Dara and explains that it is likely that the message is true, \"I believe we will find the Horn there\".\nShe then explains that she wants them to follow Fain in the Ways and use the Waygate outside Stedding Tsofu so that they can avoid Machin Shin. Although Loial and Ingtar object, she overrules them and the decision is made. When the others go to bed, Rand stays behind to ask Verin why Mat is still ill, \"I thought you Healed him\". Apparently, the Healing didn't work as well as they had hoped and Mat has only \"another few weeks, at most\". Rand sees this as another attempt to tangle him in Aes Sedai affairs and tells Verin that after they have found the Horn, there will be \"nothing between me and any Aes Sedai\"."

              "pov_summary": "Thom returns to the inn early in the morning after performing at Barthanes' manor. He had told stories such as \"How Susa tamed Jain Farstrider\" and \"Mara and the Three Foolish Kings\" to make fun of the nobles. The nobles listened to the stories but \"they had laughed in the wrong places\" and at him too, as though the money prevented him from hearing. The nobles had also asked about Rand and Thom \"was not sure his answers had been clever enough\". Before returning to his inn, Thom visits the inn that Rand was staying but Rand had already left and Thom had \"a feeling of something not done\".\nWhen he returns to his inn, he goes straight to his room only to find Dena lying on the bed with a \"gash across her throat\". A creaking door gives Thom a warning that he is not alone in the room and so he turns and throws his knives, killing one man and injuring the other. The second assassin tries to run but Thom grabs him \"and thrust the blade to within an inch of the man's dark eye\". Before Thom kills the man, he wants to know why two assassins were in his room. The answer is one that is extremely common in Cairhien, Daes Dae'mar; \"Nothing against you personal\". The man explains that he was sent by Barthanes to find out about \"this Andoran lord\" but Thom doesn't quite believe him since he was at Barthanes' manor that morning. The man offers money in return for information on Rand, \"We could both fill our pockets\", but Thom admits that Rand is just \"a shepherd in a fancy coat\". Then he tells the assassin that \"You've made one real mistake in it all\" and that was killing Dena; he then kills the assassin.\nZera walks in to Thom's room soon after and tells him \"that two of Barthanes's men were asking after you\" but sees that she is too late. Zera tells him that he must leave Cairhien but Thom explains that he has \"another man to kill\". Zera explains that he can't kill Barthanes; news of his death has already spread throughout the city. His body was \"torn to pieces in his bedchamber\" and the only way that he could be identified \"was his head stuck on a spike\". She explains that his murder and that of the two assassins will link it to Thom and so he must leave Cairhien before he is charged with murder. Thom suggests that he might go to Caemlyn but Zera points out that \"Caemlyn is as bad as Cairhien, for you\". Thom then gives her money for Dena's funeral; although he is too sad to say what it is actually for.\nWhen Zera looks at the bodies, she tells Thom that they aren't Barthanes' men, \"at least, that one isn't\"; he worked for Galldrian so the King must have caused Dena's death. Zera warns him that he can't possibly try to kill the King, \"you'll be dead before you get within a hundred spans of him\", but their conversation is cut short by a commotion coming from the city walls. Thom sees that there is a fire in the distance and knows that \"someone is firing the granaries\". He suggests that Zera leave Cairhien as well, but she refuses, \"I have lived through riots before\". Thom leaves but not before Zera warns him again to be careful to which Thom replies \"Who could I possibly be dangerous to?\""

              "setting": "Falme",
              "pov_summary": "The point of view changes now to that of Fain who is nearing Falme. The horse that carries the Horn belonged to a Darkfriend who was killed and then eaten by the Trollocs. Fain rides towards Falme thinking about how \"the soldiers did not seem to be watching the armed men they had supposedly conquered\" and about local people he has 'asked' about the Seanchan. Some of the information \"he had discarded as rumours\" but as he rides towards Falme, he sees that some of it is true. He looked at a group of soldiers riding creatures \"that were certainly not horses\" and then continued towards the town where he senses tension despite the fact that \"it all seemed peaceful on the surface\".\nFain rides to the house of the High Lord Turak and asks to see him, saying that he has \"something here that will interest your Great Lord\", which is in fact the Horn of Valere. When asked if he has sworn the oaths, he replies, \"I obey, await, and will serve\" before letting the guards see the chest that contains the Horn and the dagger. The guards are suitably impressed, \"A gift fit for the Empress herself\", and let Fain into the house after they have searched him. The soldier on the door frowns when Fain doesn't react to the strange Seanchan creatures but Fain considers them to be \"certainly no worse than Trollocs\".\nFain is shown in to the room where Turak is and he sees that the man standing beside him, Huon, is only a servant but obviously a very important one. There he presents the chest to Turak who wants to know where he found \"a chest many lesser lords could not afford\". Fain explains that his shabby state \"allowed me to bring this to you unmolested\" and that the contents of the box would allow Turak \"to take this land, as far as you wish\"; as leader of the Hailene, this is what Turak should want. Turak has known similar chests and so he is able to open it, which displeases Fain because \"it lessened his bargaining position\". Fain tells Turak that it is the Horn of Valere but Turak doesn't seem too surprised and leads Fain into another room.\nServants bring in a stand and a table to rest the Horn on, \"under the direction of the man with the braid\". Losing his patience, Fain reaches for the dagger, \"the dagger was a part of him\", but is hit by Huon for touching Turak's property. Fain tells them that the dagger is his but Turak doesn't quite believe him, \"Inside a chest you could not open\", but tells Fain that if his story interests him, \"I may give you the dagger\". Fain suggests that Turak could sound the Horn but Turak needs more convincing on why he would \"give your land to me\". Fain then tells Turak his supposed family history.\nHe claims that his family \"served the High King, Artur Paendrag Tanreall\" and they did not abandon their oaths when he died. The oaths require his family to \"await the return of Artur Hawkwing's blood\", the Seanchan, and when they do return, they are to \"serve and advise, as we did the High King\". Since the Seanchan are the descendants of Artur Hawkwing's armies, this requires Fain to serve the Seanchan, which he claims that he will do, \"I only wish to serve and advise\". Turak still wants to know where Fain found the Horn and Fain explains that too. He claims that \"The Horn was found by an ancestor of mine\" and it has been passed down from generation to generation. Turak is still not quite convinced of his story but is convinced of the Horn's authenticity and tells Fain that he will \"present it to the Empress as the chiefest of my trophies\". Fain tries to protest but Huon hits him because \"some words are never used to the High Lord\".\nTurak explains why he won't sound the Horn himself; \"whoever blows the Horn of Valere is linked to it thereafter\" so if he blew it, he could not present it to the Empress. He is twelfth in line for the throne but the heir most favoured by the Empress is Tuon, her second daughter. The Empress would see the Horn as a threat to Tuon and herself, which would not reflect well on Turak. He also explains that the Listeners of Seanchan can be anyone and everywhere and how Fain could be killed \"for a misspoken word, for a whim\" and asks him if he is still willing to serve. Fain accepts this knowledge and is told to come back tomorrow to entertain Turak with \"tales of your family and its tradition\". Before he leaves, Fain tells Turak that Darkfriends are still trying to find the Horn, led by Rand al'Thor, which is a trap for Rand that will result in Rand being killed and his story having more credibility."

              "pov_summary": "The group travel to Stedding Tsofu and while Verin presses for speed, Ingtar is still uneasy about following the message Fain left for them. Both Rand and Perrin \"rode with grim determination\" and Perrin breaks his silence by asking Loial questions about the stedding. He asked if wolves could enter the stedding and Loial replied that \"only creatures of the shadow\" were reluctant to enter a stedding, along with Aes Sedai who \"could not touch the True Source inside a stedding\". Mat seemed eager to reach the stedding but it was becoming very noticeable that Mat was ill, even though \"Verin put her hands on him for Healing\" several times.\nOn the second day after they left Cairhien, the group enter the calm of the stedding. This left \"a feeling of refreshment\" in Rand, along with the loss of not being able to touch saidin. Not long after they entered the stedding, they meet \"Erith, daughter of Iva daughter of Alar\" who requests that they leave some of the soldiers outside the boundaries of the stedding because \"it is always unsettling to have very many armed humans in the stedding\". Ingtar arranges it so that he and Hurin are the Shienarans to enter the stedding and so the group are allowed \"to follow Erith deeper into the stedding\".\nWhile they walk, Loial explains what the Longing is after he mentions it to Perrin. He explains that \"Ogier are bound to the stedding\" and if they leave the stedding for too long, the Longing causes Ogier to become weak and eventually die if they don't return to their homes. Before the male Aes Sedai broke the world, Ogier could travel freely without the Longing but when the Breaking occurred, Ogier could not find the stedding. During this period, called The Exile by Ogier, they were first struck by the Longing, \"the desire to know the stedding again\". Rand is anxious that Loial might be struck by the Longing while he travels with them but Loial explains, \"I will know when it comes\". Loial also adds \"it is a dull life in the stedding compared to travelling with three ta'veren\".\nWhile they walk they hear a song sung by the Ogier:\n\"Clear the field, smooth it low. Let no weed or stubble stand. Here we labour, here we toil, here the towering trees will grow\"\nWhile listening to the song, Rand notices a tree \"that must have been twenty paces thick\" which is identified by Loial as being a Great Tree. The group see many Ogier now, \"walking among the trees\", who all nodded in welcome. \"Rand found himself envying them\" for their carefree manner and how \"they knew and liked who and what they were\". He notices that the older male Ogier wore moustaches and beards while the younger Ogier were smooth-shaven. The older female Ogier had most of their clothes embroidered with flowers while with the younger Ogier \"embroidery was limited to the cloaks\". Several of the female Ogier paid attention to Loial who was getting more and more nervous, \"ears twitching more wildly the further they went\". The Ogier houses are built into the \"grassy wildflower-covered mounds\" and the window frames had \"been sculpted by wind and water\".\nAs they walk, Erith points out the other three human guests in the stedding, three Aiel Maidens of the Spear, and Ingtar loosens his sword as if he is afraid that they will attack. His fear is correct because when the Maidens spot them and cover their faces, something an Aiel will only do before attacking. As \"they advances at a deliberate pace\", Rand, Hurin and Ingtar draw their swords and Perrin \"had his axe half out of the loop\". Mat refuses to hurt a woman and doesn't ready his bow while Verin and Erith try to stop the Maidens by asking them, or in Verin's case, ordering them to stop, \"Stop this immediately\". Loial talks about a pact; \"Remember the Pact\", to get them to stop but they only halt their attack when another Ogier, Juin, persuades them to stop, \"Put up your weapons\". Once reminded of the Pact by Juin, the three Aiel appear extremely embarrassed and \"uncovered their heads and faces\", apologising to Juin. One of the Maidens, Rhian, explains that they felt threatened by seeing armed men in the stedding.\nJuin then addresses Verin and asks her to accompany him to see the Elders and Verin gives \"the Aiel a regretful look\" as though she would like to talk to them. The Aiel study the rest of the group, giving Rand stares of contempt because \"He is wearing a sword\". Ingtar is surprised that they stopped their attack \"once they veiled their faces\" but Erith explains that the Aiel \"would not break the Pact once it was recalled to them\" and that they visit the stedding for sung wood. Stedding Tsofu has two Treesingers and Erith tells them that \"Stedding Shangtai has a young Treesinger\", not knowing that he is in fact Loial. Erith then leads them to a house made for humans where they can wait; \"the Ogier had done their best making something that would be comfortable for humans\".\nOnce there, Mat and Perrin explain that they think that looking for sung wood was an excuse and the Maidens were looking for He Who Comes With the Dawn. They explain their meeting with Urien to Rand and add that they think that the Aiel may in fact be looking for Rand, \"since you're the only Aiel we know\". Rand denies the connection even though what Tam and the Amyrlin said connects him to the Aiel. As they wait in the house, Ogier women bring in \"water and towels and fruit and wine\" for the group and as time wears on and more Ogier come to see them, Loial becomes more and more nervous. When Rand asks him why he has \"been as nervous as a cat in a dogyard\", Loial explains that he is afraid that one of the young female Ogier will want to be his wife. According to Ogier customs, \"If a girl sees a boy she likes, she goes to her mother\" or if a mother sees a suitable male Ogier, she will tell her daughter. The mother then contacts the mother of the male Ogier and the \"next thing the boy knows, his marriage is arranged\". Male Ogier have no say in the arrangements and so Loial is very worried about this. \"If they discover I'm Outside without permission\", Loial knows that he will be married to a young Ogier extremely quickly and she won't let him leave the stedding \"until I have grey in my beard\".\nAlthough Mat laughs at this and says, \"Among us, men do the choosing\" but when Rand thinks about it, his relationship with Egwene was arranged similarly. After Mistress al'Vere and Tam talked, since Kari al'Thor had died, everyone \"had acted as if he and Egwene were promised\". Rand points out to Mat that his father never did \"anything your mother really didn't want him to do\" and Mat stops laughing. Juin then comes into the room and asks them to accompany him, \"The Elders would see you\". Loial is very reluctant to go but Rand and Mat convince him to go, \"I bet it isn't about you at all\". Loial points out that he doesn't have much choice, \"Stay and get married, or travel the Ways\"."

They are determined to reach Toman Head quickly, in order to put a stop to Padan Fain and his evil schemes.\nJuin leads Rand and company to meet the Elders. After quite a bit of debate, Loial nervously decides to sit out the meeting. It is clear that Loial is afraid of what sort of judgement the Elders will pass on him for running away from his home in Stedding Shangtai, and he is also quite nervous about the possibility of being ordered to marry Erith (or some other Ogier woman) and being forced to stay in the stedding, instead of continuing his adventures. Rand and the others see that Verin is already present in the massive Ogier hall. Rand realizes that the size of the hall, being built on the larger scale of the Ogier, would dwarf the size of many large (human) palaces.\nRand, Mat and Perrin are quickly introduced to Alar, the Eldest of the Elders who warns them that traveling the Ways is dangerous. She introduces them to Trayal, an Ogier who became brain damaged while traveling the Ways. Two Ogier women lead Trayal in to the room; he would barely be able to walk without their assistance. He is drooling and unable to speak. His eyes appear blank and his expression seems slack. Mysteriously, Verin seems able to Delve him, and announces that he is \"empty,\" devoid of a soul.\nRand, Perrin and Mat are determined to go through the Ways anyway, and Alar makes Rand promise that he will return Loial safely to Stedding Shangtai. The boys catch up with Loial who is carrying a flower that Erith has given him. They all joke around about which of them is more popular with girls.\nPretty soon, the boys meet up with Juin, Ingtar, Uno and the other soldiers and realize that they've come to the Waygate already. Rand is a little creeped out when he realizes he can sense saidin again, and he very much wants to keep his ability to channel a secret. Verin opens the gate, but Rand sees that Machin Shin is directly behind it and warns her to close it. Verin puzzles over this, and Rand worries that Machin Shin is following him somehow. Ingtar says he wants to return to Cairhien.\nAt this point, Hurin suggests using a Portal Stone to get to Toman Head in order to catch up with Padan Fain, who is now in possession of both Mat's cursed ruby dagger and the Horn of Valere. Rand volunteers to try and find the Stone, even though he dreads the idea of channeling again. Verin leads everyone to believe that it is she who will be able to activate the Portal Stone. Everyone believes her misdirection easily enough, as they have no reason to believe that anyone but an Aes Sedai would be using a Portal Stone. In fact, Verin intends for Rand to use the Portal Stone. Verin commands Alar to take them to it."

Verin briskly hints that it is time for Alar and Juin (another Ogier who has been acting as an intermediary between Alar and the Emond's Fielders) to go.\nAlar and Juin leave. Ingtar once again raises the idea of riding to Cairhien. Ingtar is eager to find the Horn of Valere and believes that they might find some leads there. He is not happy about trying to use alternate means to travel, and he doesn't see any real proof that Padan Fain has run away to Toman Head. Verin subtly implies that he is a coward. Ingtar hotly denies this, and agrees to travel to Toman Head by whatever means necessary.\nVerin calls Rand up to the Stone, implying that he will help her, because he's traveled using a Portal Stone, \"more recently than her.\" In fact, she has never used a Stone, which is why Rand's use is \"more recent.\" Rand is determined that no one will learn that he is able to channel, and he is dreading having to use the One Power again (and looking forward to it as well, in a sick sort of way). They puzzle over the markings for a bit and finally Verin urges Rand to pick a glyph at random. Rand picks a symbol with an arrow which has broken free of a circle; the arrow points in the direction of Toman Head and it has broken free in the same way that he wishes he could break free of the whole situation.

He and Tam are attacked by Trollocs and killed.\n...Rand has married Egwene and stayed in the Two Rivers, but is sometimes taken by black moods. They have several children and Tam dotes upon his grandsons and granddaughters. Invading descendants of Artur Hawkwing have long since taken control of the entire continent and completely destroyed all Aes Sedai. Egwene becomes the Wisdom and is well known for her miraculous cures. She is not able to completely Heal Rand from his frequent sicknesses and depression, however. Many years later, Egwene passes away and in his old age, Rand develops a wasting sickness. Trollocs and other creatures from the Blight begin a campaign upon all the lands south of the Blight. During their series of attacks Rand joins the defending forces even though he is old and several of his fingers have fallen off due to his wasting disease. He has a moment in the final battle where he feels completely enraged by the sight of the banner of the forces of darkness and he feels especially called to fight them. While Rand is busy firing arrows at the approaching forces in the distance, a Trolloc (one of many who have cleared the nearby river in the battle) runs him through and Rand dies.\n...Rand is inconsolable when Egwene mysteriously dies at a very young age. Rand's father Tam teaches him swordplay and decides to send Rand to Illian to see if he can get work as a soldier there. Rand has his money stolen in Baerlon, meets Min who he is initially attracted to, but he finds that she tells him too many \"strange things\" and runs away from her to Caemlyn. Rand flounders around until he is able to get a job in the Queen's Guard. Once in a great while, Rand has strange feelings towards the Daughter-Heir Elayne, feelings that are improper coming from a soldier towards a future queen. Rand realizes that he has the ability to channel. He keeps the ability a closely guarded secret but he carefully uses his ability to win on the battlefield, becoming a leader of the Guard. Rand becomes sick with a wasting disease. Descendants of Artur Hawkwing invade and in the massive battle that ensues, Rand hurls lightning and fire and is killed by an errant bolt of lightning.\n...Rand \"was a soldier, shepherd, beggar, king, farmer, gleeman, sailor, carpenter. He was born, lived, and died an Aiel. He died mad, he died rotting, he died of sickness, accident, age. (...) A hundred lives. More. So many he could not count them.\"\n... and they all land with a thud at their destination. Everyone is disoriented, to say the least. Verin surmises that they have all seen alternate versions of their lives, and guesses that they have spent four months traveling because it now appears to be late fall. Ingtar seems particularly upset saying that he will \"Walk in the Light, and find the Horn\" and Verin uses a refreshing Healing on him. Mat reassures Rand that he would never betray him, which makes Rand wonder what Mat had seen in his alternate lives. Perrin says that he doesn't feel they had very many choices, and that certain things seemed inevitable. Verin suggests that they all start heading west. Verin offers to Heal Mat and Mat pointedly refuses any Aes Sedai help. Rand hopes that they aren't too late to stop Fain."

              "pov_summary": "The chapter opens with Egwene, Nynaeve and Min sitting in Egwene's spartan novice quarters in the White Tower. Egwene is sitting on her bed and juggling balls of light made of saidar. She loves channeling, and is finding that she has quite a bit of difficulty in restraining herself from channeling nearly non-stop despite any warnings that it is dangerous and that she runs a risk of burning herself out. Nynaeve is grimly pacing back and forth and ignoring the other girls. Min is sitting on a stool and gossips about novice Else's crush on Galad. After a bit of blushing, Egwene admits that she thinks that Galad is good looking. Min warns her that he is a good person, but that her viewings show her that he lacks compassion, \"He'd hurt a person because he had to serve a greater good.\"\nElayne bursts in and announces that King Galldrian is dead and there's a civil war on in Cairhien. Min scoffs at the news and mentions other conflicts including rumors of war in Cairhien, war on Toman Head, war in Tear over a false Dragon being caught in Saldaea. She also mentions a rumor that Artur Hawkwing's armies in Tanchico.\nEgwene mentions seeing the gentled Logain sitting around and crying in one of the Tower courtyards, and secretly worries about Rand being gentled. She privately muses that she hasn't had any important seeming dreams lately, but she reports all of her dreams to Anaiya Sedai, trying to see if she has a Dreaming Talent.\nNynaeve is still pacing. Min whispers to Elayne that Nynaeve got in a fistfight with Accepted Irella and that she's just come back from Sheriam, the Mistress of Novices' office. Overhearing them gossiping about her makes Nynaeve angry enough to channel a wind that knocks Min off of her chair. Nynaeve offers to let Min turn her in to Sheriam, the Mistress of Novices, but the two girls forgive each other instead. Elayne runs to the door to check if anyone has seen. From the balcony, she can see that it rained last night. Even though it is noon, most of the novices have returned from the Tower gardens and are spending their freeday catching up on sleep.\nElayne joins Egwene in juggling balls of light and Nynaeve threatens to turn them in for channeling without permission. The One Power sharpens Egwene's senses. Nynaeve worries that they are not cautious enough in their training. Nynaeve tells them that she is terrified that she will draw too much of the Power and \"burn to a crisp.\" Elayne replies that the only thing that terrifies her is that she has to wash dishes all the time. Elayne admits that she considers running off with the Traveling People, but Nynaeve reminds her that she cannot run from saidar because it is everywhere.\nElayne asks Min to do a viewing for them, and Min refuses, saying she doesn't like to read friends. Just at that moment, Min has a viewing that they will all be in great danger soon. Elayne tries to lighten the mood by telling Min that she should wear a dress to attract her brother Gawyn's attention. Min says she prefers to wear boy's clothes.\nLiandrin Sedai of the Red Ajah bursts into their room. This is unusual because they hadn't heard of Liandrin returning to the White Tower yet, and usually if an Aes Sedai wants to speak to a novice, the novice is sent for. Aes Sedai almost never come directly to the novice quarters. The room is crowded with five people in it.\nLiandrin tells Nynaeve that because she is an Accepted she shouldn't continue to stay friends with novices. Liandrin then orders Elayne and Min to leave. Egwene is eager to hear if Liandrin has some news of Rand. Liandrin tells the Emond's Fielders that Rand, Mat and Perrin are in danger, but that the girls can help. Liandrin hints that she has been working with Moiraine who is concerned for the boys' safety. Liandrin tells the girls to meet her that evening in the nearby Ogier grove where she will take them to Toman Head, frightens them by mentioning the Black Ajah and leaves.\nNynaeve and Elayne worry that Liandrin, a member of the Red Ajah, may have unpleasant plans for Rand. They are puzzled at the idea of Moiraine and Liandrin working together. Elayne and Min return, having eavesdropped on the conversation from the other room and are determined to accompany Nynaeve and Egwene. Min tells them that her viewing gives her a sense that they should stick together. Nynaeve starts making plans for their departure and Egwene privately continues to worry about Rand."

              "pov_summary": "Elayne, Egwene and Nynaeve are sneaking out of the Tower dressed as noblewomen and Min is disguised as their boy servant. There is a quite a crowd of locals in from town, waiting for audiences with various Aes Sedai and the girls blend right in. The girls are surprised to find that no one really makes any effort to challenge them? after so many weeks as novices and Accepted, they've gotten somewhat used to the idea that they will be barked at for stepping out of place, and are surprised and pleased to find their escape going ahead so smoothly. Egwene realizes that she feels uncomfortable wearing fine clothes after having spent so much time in plain novice white. Min is left with the unpleasant task of carrying all of their saddlebags in her guise as their servant.\nThings get a little dodgy as the girls nearly run into Takima Sedai of the Brown Ajah. They turn onto a side hall where they see Irella (an Accepted) dragging Else (a fellow novice) along by her ear. Irella and Else don't take any notice of the four girls, because of their fancy clothes. Elayne says that she is ready for some adventure. Fortunately, Elayne, Egwene, Nynaeve and Min get to the stables without further incident.\nAt the stables, Nynaeve intimidates the stableman into saddling four horses for them. Nynaeve tries to look very commanding and Aes Sedai-like, but the stableman has already been given orders to have horses ready for two of them. Egwene is a little surprised and almost insulted to realize that Liandrin had already made arrangements for them, because the Aes Sedai had assumed that the girls wouldn't be capable of sneaking out on their own. Elayne tosses the stableman a coin as they leave in order to create a little goodwill and smooth over the harshness of Nynaeve's words. The girls have an uneventful ride to the Ogier grove.\nAt the grove, the girls meet Liandrin who is quite upset to find that Min and Elayne have tagged along. Nynaeve and Egwene realize that Liandrin means for them to travel through the Ways. Liandrin opens the gate by removing the trefoil Avendesora leaf carving. Egwene, riding Bela, leaps through faster than she intended. Time seems to move slower in the Ways and she finds the transition rather jarring. Nynaeve follows, bringing lanterns, which Egwene is very grateful for. The darkness of the Ways seems to press in on the light from the lanterns making them dimmer than they should be. Min and Elayne join them with Liandrin bringing up the rear.\nLiandrin leads the four girls through acid-pitted and crumbling paths, continually checking their location at Guidings. She pulls out a parchment which she consults from time to time, but doesn't allow Egwene or Nynaeve to peek at it. They walk along ramps, bridges, and Islands. Nynaeve wonders if the paths are laid out in some physically impossible layout, with islands stacked directly over each other and Egwene agrees that this seems to be the case, which everyone finds rather disconcerting. Egwene feels like even saidar is slightly tainted in the Ways.\nAfter a long walk which takes them most of the day, Liandrin informs them it will take them two days to get to Toman Head, and instructs the girls make camp for the night. They have flatbread and cheese for dinner, while Liandrin aloofly sits apart from them. Egwene asks Liandrin about what to do if they encounter Machin Shin and Liandrin nastily informs them that she will take care of it.\nAs the girls get ready for bed they talk amongst themselves about Rand. Min asks Egwene how she will feel if Rand chooses to marry Elayne or Min instead of her. Egwene bravely counters that she doesn't think she'll ever marry, and she wishes luck on anybody who ends up with Rand. The girls go to sleep and Egwene has nightmares about a man with burning eyes. Liandrin wakes them in the \u201cmorning\u201d and pushes them hard for the next two days, until finally she announces that they have arrived at their destination."

She also sees a tall, dark, hook-nosed man; women in gray dresses with silver collars, women in dresses with forked lightning insignias and a curiously dressed noblewoman in a palanquin.\nLiandrin presents Egwene, Nynaeve and Elayne to the High Lady Suroth, the woman in the palanquin. The hook-nosed man wastes no time and collars Egwene! Egwene is alarmed to find that the collar seems to be all of one piece, although obviously it must have had a clasp of some sort in order to be put on her. She tries to fight back and punches one of the women and is shocked when she feels the punch reverberate as if she herself had been punched in the eye. After the confusion dies down, Nynaeve and Elayne somehow escape, while Min remains rather dazed after having tried to use her knife on the hook-nosed man.\nRenna the sul'dam begins explaining that Egwene is a damane and that she must obey the sul'dam completely, and demonstrates how she is able to make Egwene feel pain while she is collared. Suroth is upset that Liandrin let two of the girls escape. Liandrin mocks Suroth and makes mention of their \"master.\" Suroth threatens to collar Liandrin, and the two exchange threats for a time. Liandrin reminds Suroth that it is vital for her to get Egwene and Nynaeve across the Aryth Ocean. Finally, Suroth commands her men to stop the hunt for Nynaeve and Liandrin escapes back into the Ways before the patrols can capture her as well.\nAt this point, Elbar, the hook-nosed man asks permission from Suroth to kill Min as punishment for having fought against him earlier. Egwene begins yelling at them, which makes Renna punish her. Suroth decides to spare Min's life in order to make Egwene more amenable to her training as a damane.\nEgwene asks Renna who Suroth and Liandrin's master is, and Renna tells her affairs of the Blood are none of her business. Renna also informs Egwene that punishments for damane include losing their tongues or hands, since damane don't need these in order to channel. Renna tells Egwene the story of Deain, the Aes Sedai who invented the collar, explains that there are no male sul'dam and Alwhin, the other sul'dam says that while most men feel nothing when they put on the bracelet, there are a few who die screaming from trying to link with a damane.\nRenna commands Egwene to blow up a tree, and when Egwene refuses, Renna punishes her again. When Min tries to help, one of the other damane is ordered to punish Min as well. Renna feels that Egwene will be one of the best damane when she is properly trained."

Though \"neither rain nor cold had any effect on a trail\", Hurin hasn't been able to locate the Trollocs. The morale of the group is very low but Verin is so \"lost in thought to even notice that her hood had slipped back\" that she doesn't appear to be miserable. Rand asks her if she can do something about the rain, even though \"a small voice told him he could do it himself\". Verin admits that she could make the storm lessen, but not stop, where they are, \"I couldn't stop a storm this big\", but if she did, it would require too much channeling. \"Any Aes Sedai closer than ten miles would know someone had channeled\" and the Seanchan and their damane would quickly find them.\nRand and the others had found out some information about the Seanchan at a village called Atuan's Mill though the information \"hatched more questions than it answered\". The villagers told them about the Seanchan and their damane and monsters; the fact that \"Aes Sedai were leashed frightened the villagers even more than the strange creatures\". The Seanchan had made an example in the village and though the dead had been buried, \"they feared to clean away the large charred patch in the village square\". Hurin refused to go near the patch, showing that something horrendous had happened there. The village had been quite empty because most villagers had fled to Falme or had gone on to the Almoth Plain to escape.\nPerrin wants to know why the Horn was brought here and Ingtar's answer is that \"there are always men who see chances for their own advantage in the confusion of war\". Verin suggests that the reasons why the Father of Lies acts as he does are \"known only in Shayol Ghul\". Mat voices his opinions about the Seanchan's monsters and says \"They saw some Trollocs, or a Fade\". Even though they're Shadowspawn, Mat explains that the Seanchan fight with leashed Aes Sedai so why couldn't they fight with Trollocs on their side.\nMat's explanation is cut short when Masema rides up to the group and points out that there is an abandoned village up ahead, \"It's empty. No villagers, no Seanchan\". When they arrive in the village, they see that most of the buildings are intact but a few have been destroyed. Uno leads a search of the village while the others take shelter in the abandoned inn. Hurin explains that though neither the Trollocs nor Fain have been in the village, \"Whoever did that left a stench\" and Ingtar assumes that it was the Seanchan.\nIngtar moans that they \"will never find the Horn of Valere this way\" and that Fain could have taken it practically anywhere by now. However, Verin and Rand contradict him by explaining that Fain went to Falme and has remained there. Ingtar goes on to ask about the Seanchan but Verin explains \"Who they are is not important to us\", though she goes on to speculate that the writings in Fal Dara suggested that they really are the descendants of Artur Hawkwing. Ingtar interrupts her by saying that he thinks the writing \"could have been a trick as easily as a dark prophecy\" and that he must trust his instincts. Rand then admits to the group that if he doesn't find Fain, \"he will do something to hurt Emond's Field\" and that it was part of Fain's message. Ingtar is disbelieving of this but Loial is willing to follow Rand and Mat, Perrin and Hurin are convinced that Hurin can find the Horn if they get close to Fain. Verin warns Rand about openly walking into Falme since \"you may find yourself a prisoner, or worse\".\nWhen Uno comes into the room, Ingtar tells them of his plan to disguise the soldiers in clothes found in the village. They will then \"swing wide, north and south, until you find the trail\". Rand tells Verin that there is something \"pulling me to Falme\" and that there isn't much time. He then goes to one of the inn's bedrooms to get some sleep. However, Ba'alzamon is there and holds the Dragon's banner. Rand is called Lews Therin by him and is told that he is \"set to a course that you cannot change\", one of madness and death. He wants to know if Rand will earn the name Kinslayer himself before he dies. Rand denies that he is the Dragon but Ba'alzamon claims that he knows Rand too well since \"I have faced you a thousand times\". Rand swears that he will die before serving the Shadow but Ba'alzamon claims that Rand will die and has done so over and over again throughout the spinning of the Wheel. He says that this time the Wheel will stop spinning and the Shadow will rule and asks if Rand will choose death or life and power.\nRand seizes saidin and channels the One Power at Ba'alzamon only to watch it disappear \"into that black mist\". He then drank more and more of saidin while Ba'alzamon told him \"You will destroy yourself\". Rand thinks about what he must do and how \"I can't die yet\" and so releases saidin. Ba'alzamon then gives him back the banner before warning him \"The Wheel itself holds you prisoner to your fate Age after Age\". He then claims that he alone can free him and \"teach you how to wield the Power\". He offers to help Rand if he joins the Shadow but Rand refuses and Ba'alzamon disappears. Everything in his room was in its place as if it had only been a dream but \"on the chair back, tendrils of smoke still rose from the charred impressions of fingers\"."

Nynaeve is sickened by the sight while the Falmen are obviously terrified of the pair because \"they made way for those two even more quickly than they did for the Seanchan soldiers\". Nynaeve is so disgusted by the a'dam that \"she could not imagine doing that to any woman\", except Liandrin because she caused the capture of Egwene and Min and she is of the Black Ajah. While she is still looking at the damane, she sees a man out of the corner of her eye that looked as though it was Fain, though she dismisses that thought quickly.\nWhile Nynaeve was looking around the street, Elayne had stolen several apples from one of the stalls, though Nynaeve maintains \"we don't have to steal\". Elayne argues that the money is quickly running out and Nynaeve has been suspiciously full at each meal. Nynaeve thinks to herself that the price of everything is too high and the Falmen have complained \"about how the prices had risen since the Seanchan came\". When they are walking through the streets, Nynaeve demands to know how Elayne managed to steal the apples, wanting to know if Elayne channeled, something foolish to do when a damane and sul'dam are near. Elayne admitted that she did, but only after she \"looked carefully to make sure there was no damane close\".\nElayne is surprised and more than a little angry that the Falmen have not resisted the Seanchan invasion, \"They should resist. They should fight back\". Before Nynaeve can make a proper retort, they see a Seanchan patrol approach and both of them bow to the soldiers, although Elayne is slightly reluctant to do so. Nynaeve is relieved that the guards are riding horses rather than the other creatures that the Seanchan ride. When the patrol has gone, Nynaeve says \"If we are caught, I swear that before they kill us I will beg them on bended knees to let me strip you\" for Elayne's carelessness. Elayne is indignant about the accusation of carelessness and reminds Nynaeve of when she channeled in plain view of a damane. Nynaeve had channeled the a'dam collar open but despite the fact that damane are poorly treated, \"it had been the woman in the collar who had raised the alarm\".\nThinking back to their previous conversation, Nynaeve thinks about the lack of resistance to the Seanchan. Although \"she thought Elayne was at least partly right\", she knows that very few people could stand up to the Seanchan monsters and the damane. Everybody Nynaeve had talked to \"took fright at the merest hint that they might oppose the Seanchan\". She looks at the buildings that house the damane, \"Egwene had to be in there, and likely Min\", and thinks that \"Being able to open the collar did no good at all unless she could reach Egwene\"."

              "pov_summary": "Egwene is sitting in her small room, her collar connected to a bracelet hung on a peg. The room had no possessions in it, \"Damane had no need for comfort, or privacy, or possessions\". Damane were possessions, owned by the Empress for the most part. Egwene thinks of how Renna is not the only sul'dam to wear the bracelet of the a'dam, \"but it was Renna who wore her bracelet four times out of five\". Egwene stands away from the window so that the damane in the garden couldn't \"see the glow as she channeled the One Power\". She probes delicately at the collar, \"the merest drip she could imagine\", in an effort to open it. Despite the size of saidar being channeled, Egwene still feels ill as this is one of the properties of the a'dam; \"if a damane tried to channel without a sul'dam wearing her bracelet, she felt sick\". Another property is that no damane can carry her a'dam if the sul'dam does not wear the bracelet because she becomes very ill. Egwene remembers that Renna made her do both and \"remembering still made her shudder\".\nThe probing of the a'dam is cut short when Min arrives for her weekly visit, wearing a dress, something unheard of for Min. She explains \"that old hag Mulaen apparently got tired of not knowing what my place was on sight\". She tries to make light of the situation but Egwene remembers how she \"had to watch her clothes being burned too\". She also remembers how anything that is given to a damane is the choice of the sul'dam; a damane would sleep on the floor, starving if a sul'dam chose it to be that way. She then tells Min that Renna has found that she has a special talent when it comes to ores. Egwene was able to distinguish copper ore from iron ore whilst blindfolded and could locate a disused iron mine. Egwene couldn't hide this knowledge from Renna because of the a'dam, \"she knew I had sensed the mine as soon as I did\". Renna told her that all sul'dam develop an affinity over time to do with the One Power.\nEgwene has strength in Earth, one of the Five Powers that is predominantly strongest among men and so she is an extremely valuable asset for the Seanchan. Her 'training' has also caused her to be able to \"handle much more of the Power now than she could before leaving Tar Valon\". Min casts a ray of hope, \"I've found us a ship\", but this is extinguished when Egwene tells her that her Talent is so rare that \"they're sending a ship back to Seanchan. Just for me\". When Egwene tells Min that there are two Aes Sedai among the damane, Min is sure that with their help, they can escape together. Egwene tells her that Ryma is beginning to loose hope and \"she's beginning to stop fighting against it\". Ryma can't commit suicide either, no damane can; a damane can't touch any object that she perceives to be a possible weapon. When Egwene thought about hitting Renna with her pitcher, she couldn't touch it until she could \"convince myself I would never hit her with it\".\nEgwene knows that the sul'dam is training her to become a perfect damane, obedient and meek. Min points out that she can't be taken to Seanchan because \"I see things I am sure link you to Rand\" and that can't happen if they are on different continents. Egwene doesn't believe that it will happen and asks Min to sail with the ship she has found. Before Min can reply, Renna comes into the room to continue Egwene's training. The moment the bracelet is fitted, Renna knows that Egwene has channeled, \"You know that it is forbidden except when we are complete\". Renna decides to discipline Egwene and gives her a new name, \"from now on, your name is Tuli\". She sends Min away so that she can discipline Egwene further. She tells Egwene that they will \"be called to the Court of the Nine Moons and I will not allow you to disgrace me\". She will punish Egwene until \"you tell me how much you love being damane (...) Make me believe every word\"."

              "pov_summary": "Min walks out of the building where the damane are kept and hears Egwene's shrieks of pain, \"she was not accustomed to feeling so helpless, so useless\". Shaking and crying, she runs away from the building in an attempt to get away from the screams, only to find Elayne and Nynaeve close to the damane quarters. When they see that Min is crying, they correctly guess that something has happened to Egwene but she lies to them, saying \"She's as well as can be expected\". Min fears that if she tells the truth, Nynaeve will do something stupid and end up being collared by an a'dam.\nAs they walk down to the harbour, Min explains that she has found a ship, \"I found a ship captain who I think will take us\", and Nynaeve agrees that it would be a good way to get away from Falme. When the question of price is raised, \"we do not have money for passage\", Min admits that \"I never got that far\". The captain wants to leave but the ships patrolling the harbour make that hard because \"there's no way of telling if there's a damane on one of those ships\". He wants a damane on his ship to fight back but since he doesn't, he is afraid to sail and Min has had to try to convince him. Min also tells them that they have to act quickly because \"they're going to send Egwene back to Seanchan, and soon\".\nElayne wishes that they had an army nearby but Nynaeve points out that \"It isn't swords or brawn we need now but brains\". Min tells Elayne that the Seanchan are very good fighters, \"The Seanchan were outnumbered and they won every battle easily\", and Nynaeve that she can get one of them into the building where the damane are kept. Nynaeve has several ideas about Egwene's escape and asks to be taken to the captain, saying \"If he is any harder to handle the Village Council I will eat this coat\". As they walk down to the harbour, Min sees two auras, one around Nynaeve and one around Elayne. \"A man's ring of heavy gold floated above Nynaeve's head, and above Elayne's, a red-hot iron and an axe\". The auras conveyed a sense of danger for them in the future but what kind of danger, Min doesn't know.\nThey meet the captain in The Three Plum Blossoms, hastily changed from The Watcher due to the Seanchan invasion, and he is Bayle Domon. When Nynaeve mentions sailing, Domon tells her that \"it will be an even wager whether he (Turak) do let me go or have my head cut off\". He also tells them that if he can leave the harbour \"without a damane rips the Spray to splinters\", he will be able to stay away from the Seanchan ships. Nynaeve then books the passage for four and tells Domon that \"you will sail with something better than damane\". She then pulls a cord out from underneath her dress that has two rings on it. Min recognises one, Lan's ring, as the one in Nynaeve's aura but Domon recognises the other ring, the ring that Aes Sedai wear. Domon admits \"there do be a chance\" that they might escape, but then warns them of the consequences of showing that ring.\nDomon saw an Aes Sedai and her Warder come to Falme after the Seanchan invasion. \"One of them must have been careless, for the Seanchan had an ambush laid for them\" and six damane shielded the Aes Sedai. From the description, one of those damane was Ryma, an Aes Sedai of the Yellow Ajah who had to betray her fellow sister. Nynaeve is unperturbed by this and tells Domon that they will sail soon and that if he doesn't agree to take them now, they will find another ship and he won't have the protection of three women who can channel. Domon agrees to sail with them aboard and the three women leave the tavern. They go back to the room Nynaeve and Elayne have hired to make a plan for freeing Egwene."

Verin explains that Loial cannot go because of the lack of Ogier on Toman Head, \"You would attract as many eyes as the rest put together\", and she cannot go because of the damane.

It's early morning so only a few people are about but they see a damane and sul'dam walk down the road towards them, the few Falmen averted their eyes and gave them a wide berth\". Nynaeve focuses all her anger, \"Leashed Ones and Leash holders. They had put their filthy collar on Egwene's neck\", and channels directly at the a'dam, opening the collar. The damane is obviously local because she punches the sul'dam and then flees. Nynaeve, Min and Elayne drag the stunned sul'dam and the a'dam into the alleyway and to a disused shed. None of the Falmen attempted to help the sul'dam, \"Nynaeve had been counting on that\".\nOnce there, they bind the sul'dam's hands, take off the bracelet of the a'dam and take away her dress and boots. The clothes are most likely to fit Nynaeve so she puts them on and Elayne starts to put on a grey dress, similar to that of a damane's. When Elayne wishes that she \"knew more of what it (a'dam) does\", Nynaeve tests it on the cowering sul'dam, \"there is one way to find out\". She wears the bracelet of the a'dam and is immediately aware of what the sul'dam is feeling. When the sul'dam laughs at her, Nynaeve has an idea and adds a sensation to \"the lump of sensations that she knew belonged to the sul'dam\". The sul'dam is then in immediate pain, despite the fact that Min says that \"it won't work any woman who cannot channel\". Nynaeve stops immediately but the sul'dam is terrified and answers her questions. Nynaeve realizes \"she could never make Elayne wear that collar\" and decides that she will use the sul'dam as a fake damane and Elayne will be a servant. She explains \"No one really looks at a damane\" and so their plan should work. When they are all dressed accordingly, they move out of the shed and head towards the building where the damane are kept."

He leaves the Dragon banner in his saddlebags in the stable, safe away from Verin's prying eyes. They walk around the town with Hurin leading, only to find that Fain's trail criss-crosses all over the town, \"it's hard to tell old from new\". As they walk, they not only see damane, which surprises them, but grolm as well. Rand and Hurin recognize the grolm from the portal worlds and have to make a conscious effort not to stare.\nThey come across Turak's house and Hurin explains \"The street stinks of layer on layer on layer of him\" and Mat can feel that the dagger is in the house too. Rand explains to a doubtful Ingtar that the Horn is probably in the house too, along with Fain and the dagger. When Rand suggests a cautious plan, Ingtar explains that \"I've waited too long\" and suggests that they act quickly. He then explains that there are gardens and alleys running behind the house and \"sometimes men are so busy guarding their front, they neglect their back\". They go round to the back and Ingtar looks over the wall to check the gardens. There is only one guard there, who is killed and hidden by Ingtar, \"the man was overconfident\". Now free to enter the house, they do so cautiously, uninterrupted until a female servant spots them, only to run away without a word. Mat follows the pull of the dagger and leads them to an unoccupied room. Sure enough, the Horn of Valere and the dagger are in the room and Mat picks up his dagger while Ingtar is in awe of the Horn, \"By Light, it is! I am saved\".\nRand crosses to the window to look at the grolm but instead sees Egwene in the damane quarters. The others try to convince him that it can't have been her, \"Egwene is safe in Tar Valon\", but before Rand can comment, they are interrupted by Turak and several Seanchan soldiers. Turak tells them that he had suspected Fain would try to steal the Horn, \"I have been suspicious of him since Huon died\", but he will kill them instead. When a soldier tries to take the Horn, Mat stabs him with his dagger, only to find that the merest scratch can kill a man in extreme agony. The dagger causes the victim's body to turn black and leaves him in agony.\nWhen the man is dead, Ingtar and the others fight with the soldiers and Rand fights Turak. Through Turak is a skilled blademaster, Rand defeats him, despite having to hold off the call of saidin throughout the fight, \"saidin flowed towards him but he ignored it\". When Turak is killed, the servants with him kill themselves, \"From birth to death I serve the Blood\". The others return to the room, obviously having fought with the guards. Despite his protests that he must save Egwene, Rand runs out of the building with Ingtar, Mat, Perrin and Hurin with the two items that they came for. They run past other Seanchan servants who haven't moved from where their masters left them and out of the building. Rand spares one last thought for Egwene, \"I will come back for her. Somehow\"."

Further, Geofram Bornhald and a thousand of the Children were killed by Aes Sedai. When Niall asks him about the army that has taken Falme and killed half of one of his legions, Byar says that they call themselves Seanchan and that Geofram Bornhald told him they were Darkfriends. Before he leaves he says that he knows that the Perrin from Two Rivers is to blame on it all.\nJaichim Carridin enters the room, and tells his Lord Captain Commander that the ones who seized Falme are Darkfriends, gathered to support the false Dragon with Aes Sedai support and that the rumors about Seanchan from across the Aryth Ocean are not true. Niall commands him to make sure that the false Dragon doesn't die and to kill any Aes Sedai who opposes him rather than supporting him. When the Inquisitator has left, Ordeith emerges from a passage in the wall. He looks at a drawing of the \"false\" Dragon, and tells Niall that it's Rand al'Thor, a Darkfriend from Two Rivers. When Ordeith tells him of Matrim Cauthon and Perrin Aybara, his two friends, close behind him in evil, Niall wonders whether he ought to make plans for the Two Rivers when the snow clears."

His thoughts drift to the Aes Sedai that seems to have them all on strings and then to Shienar, the land his companions come from. He realizes though, that he is supposed to keep watch as well. Perrin briefly considers seeking out the wolves in the region to see if there is anything wrong but he pushes that thought away quickly.\nJust as Perrin spots the rider they are waiting for Masema sees a raven. Before it can get away Perrin brings it down with his bow. The raven might report to a fade. Better to not take chances. The Shienarans can see the rider now as well and a little later Perrin leads them out of the thicket they used for cover to greet her.\nAfter the password is exchanged the woman introduces herself as Leya. She is one of the Traveling People. Perrin asks her how she found them but she gives him the answer all others have given him. She knew that if she came this way she would find someone to take her to the woman she wants to talk to.\nThere is very little talk on the way back to their camp. Leya and Perrin talk about the pacifist philosophy of the Traveling People for a while, Perrin wonders how long the strength of her belief will hold up against a Trolloc. Leya is convinced the Way of the Leaf is right though. She notices Perrin's unease with his own weapons. Perrin refuses to get into that.\nThey approach the camp late in the afternoon. It is closely guarded by the Shienarans, even if to the casual observer not a lot of them are visible. The camp itself is scarcely more than a few log huts and a couple of fireplaces. A banner with a mythical beast called a dragon ripples in the wind. Perrin welcomes Leya to the camp of the Dragon Reborn."

She refuses Perrin's offer of a hot meal asking only that her horse, Piesa, will be looked after. Perrin greets the other people and goes to find himself some supper.\nMin walks up to him looking at the Tinker woman. Perrin asks what she sees around the woman and Min predicts her violent death. Perrin asks if she is sure and Min explains a bit about her talent. She sees images around people but not all the time and not around everybody. She doesn't always know what they mean or when something is going to happen but they are always true. Perrin realizes that a violent death of the Tinker woman could mean an attack on the camp. For a second time that day he considers contacting the wolves in the area to see if there is any danger. And again he pushes that thought away. Instead Perrin asks Min not to tell him what she sees around him.\nLoial joins them and picks up talk about the Tuatha'an. Min quickly tells him what she's seen around Leya. Not for the first time this winter they wish they hadn't been caught up in this adventure. Loial concludes that few choices around ta'veren are your own. He still considers himself lucky to have been around three of them at a time. He is even taking notes to write a book about recent events.\nThey see Rand coming out of Moiraine's hut. He has been arguing with her all day. Perrin sees the Shienarans treat him like he is a King. Rand disappears through a crack in the rock wall around the valley that leads to an even more secluded valley. Rand always goes there after his arguments with Moiraine. Perrin follows him. Rand needs someone to talk to after these arguments.\nHe finds Rand reciting a part of the prophecies of the Dragon. He turns to Perrin and asks if he thinks Mat is all right. Mat must be in Tar Valon by now to the receive healing he needs. Perrin asks him if Rand wishes he were still a sheepherder. Rand mutters a Shienaran saying about duty and says there isn't really anybody else who can do it. Perrin turns the conversation to Moiraine now. Rand tells him they have been arguing about the same thing. The people who have declared for him on the Almoth Plain, the fighting and dying that is going on in his name and the fact there is nothing he can do about it. Rand knows she is right about that but he needs to vent his frustration.\nRand then speaks of saidin and how it pulls him. He wants to use it despite the taint but he has very little control over it. What will happen if the last battle is upon them and he can't reach the Source? The ground starts trembling under Perrin's feet. Apparently Rand has found the source this time. He unleashes a small earthquake before he gets hold of himself again. Saidin filled him he says, and he needed to direct it somewhere before it burnt him to a crisp. Looking around at the damage he caused Rand adds he didn't mean to do that. Perrin tries to get him to return to the camp with him for supper but Rand wants to be alone for a while. Perrin returns to the camp alone."

Moiraine doesn't debate it with him but she is obviously upset. Perrin sees the damage Rand caused everywhere around them when he walks through the camp towards one of the fires.\nHe finds Min stirring a pot of stew half of which was spilled by Rand. He asks her if anybody has been hurt. Min tells him that besides some bruises, everybody is fine. Whatever Min saw regarding Leya probably hasn't happened yet. Perrin tells Min she doesn't have to stay here. He'll help her get away. He is puzzled by her reply. She refuses to go even if she thinks he is very sweet for offering. This fate may not be the one she would have chosen herself but she doesn't think it is bad because of that.\nMoiraine joins them at the fire and Min asks if the Tinker woman is all right. Moiraine says she split her scalp in the quake but that she has been Healed and is resting now. Is that what Min saw? She doesn't seem to know herself. Perrin is shocked by Moiraine's acceptance of Min's viewing but the Aes Sedai tells him the Wheel weaves as the Wheel will and that there is nothing they can do about it.\nLan, Loial and Uno join the conversation now and Moiraine tells them what she has learnt of events on Almoth Plain. Taraboners, Domani and Dragonsworn are still fighting each other and several Hunters of the Horn have taken an interest in Almoth Plain. What is most unusual though, is that the Whitecloaks have as many as five thousand men in the area. Although they had a few clashes with the Dragonsworn they seem to keep their distance from the larger groups. Still they claim to be looking for the 'false' Dragon on the plain. Loial suggests that it might be safe for Rand to go down to the Dragonsworn now but the others don't trust the Whitecloaks intention. What is even more worrying is that three tall light-eyed youths have been found dead without a trace of whoever was responsible. Uno seems to think this must be the work of the 'Soulless' but he doesn't explain what they are. Moiraine steers the conversation away from that topic.\nThe conversation turns towards their immediate safety now. Rand's action was a beacon for any Fade within ten miles so Moiraine is worried about a possible attack. There is a feeling in the air she says. Before Perrin realizes it he has described it as 'waiting'. Moiraine agrees with him. She tells Uno to make sure the guards are extra alert tonight. Other than that there doesn't seem to be a lot they can do. Perrin, who has third watch, goes to his hut to get some sleep."

Perrin doesn't understand at first but the man means his axe. Perrin tells him he will but not yet. There is something dark about the man Perrin doesn't really trust. He talks about getting away from fate. He offers Perrin a drink that will help him see things more clearly. Perrin refuses and leaves the inn. As he leaves the man tells him he won't get many chances. Three threads are woven together, if one is cut all fall.\nPerrin feels a great heat from the room briefly. He turns around but the room is empty. Staring into a mirror he sees himself as a warrior now. In fine armour but with the plain axe at his side. Part of him accepts this image and another refuses it. He puts the image out of his mind firmly. As he does so a woman's voice tells him he is destined for glory. He turns around and looks at the woman. She is so beautiful she makes all other women look clumsy by comparison. The woman talks to him about how he should reach out and grasp his destiny. Perrin tells her he just wants to be a blacksmith. She too offers him a drink but again he refuses. The woman leaves but promises she will always be in his dreams.\nThe scene changes and Perrin is dressed in plainer clothes this time. He finds himself on a stone bridge connecting two stone spires. In the distance he sees a woman in a white dress hurrying somewhere. A bit later he witnesses a meeting of three men. One of them tickles his memory but he can't quite remember where he saw him before... somewhere in an inn? The three start arguing and suddenly a huge ball of fire envelops them. Perrin ducks for cover and feels the heat of the blast. When he looks back up the whole bridge the men had been standing on has disappeared.\nPerrin tells himself it is only a dream and again the scene changes. He finds himself in an open space surrounded by huge columns of Redstone. In the open space he sees a crystal sword. Perrin knows it is somehow important. Callandor. He doesn't know where that name came from but that is what the sword is called. Perrin remembers now he's had this dream before. At that moment the wolves finally manage to contact him.

He tells her to get back inside and hide but she doesn't seem to hear him. Perrin tries to get to her but his path is blocked by several Trollocs. By the time he has cut his way through them a Fade has reached Leya. With casual ease the Fade kills the Tinker woman. An enraged Perrin now attacks the Fade while in his mind the wolves let him know they are coming. He kills the Fade and kneels down next to Leya but there is no time to mourn. The wolves call him back to the battle.\nThe wolf in Perrin takes over now. He loses all sense of the greater battle but only focuses on the next Trolloc he slays. And the next. And the next. Finally the Trollocs run, pursued by the remaining wolves. Perrin wants to join them. He feels the wolves kill the last Fade and howls with them in mourning of the wolves that perished.\nWhen he lowers his head Min is there asking him if he is all right. Lan saves him from answering the question Min no doubt has by praising him. He fought well tonight. An embarrassed Perrin tells Min Leya is dead and that he was too late to prevent it. Min says it wouldn't have made a difference.\nIn the meantime, Masema sees in the fact that the wolves joined their fight a sign. He says they must go forth in the name of the Dragon Reborn. Uno quickly shuts him up by saying they are not going anywhere till Rand says so. He also suggests skinning the wolves for their hides but Perrin insists they be buried with the human dead. Nobody dares to argue with him.\nPerrin wants to know where Rand is. Min says he doesn't want to talk to anybody, but Perrin goes to see him anyway. Rand tells him how he tried to use saidin to kill the Trollocs and that he couldn't get hold of the Source at first. When he did he couldn't do anything useful with it. Rand says he was no use in that battle whatsoever. Perrin tries to make him feel a bit better but without much success.\nLan and Moiraine join them to see to their wounds. Perrin's are not that bad. Moiraine Heals them for him. Min refuses Healing, she doesn't have any wounds worth mentioning. Rand holds his side though. He has not been involved in the fighting but the wound he took at Falme burst open again. Moiraine tries to Heal him as well. After she has done as much as she can she passes out from exhaustion.

Perrin thinks the signs of religious madness in Masema are disturbing.\nWhen he arrives at Moiraine's hut he finds Moiraine, Loial and Min there already. He shares his opinion on Masema with the others but of course there are more important matters to discuss. Moiraine doesn't know yet how Rand left but the guards didn't see him go. Rand left a cryptic message mentioning his dreams. Moiraine is worried about Rand, she doesn't believe he is ready to face all the dangers the world holds for him. Perrin and Moiraine get in a decidedly unpleasant conversation about the Forsaken.\nWhen the conversation comes back to dreams again, Uno and Lan enter. Moiraine wants to know what dreams Perrin has had. He reluctantly describes them. Moiraine immediately recognizes the Stone of Tear and Callandor from what Perrin tells her. She sends Lan and Uno out to ask about the dreams the other men in the camp had. People strong in spirit can force their dreams on others. While Lan is gone she tells them about how drawing Callandor, the sword that is not a sword, the sword that cannot be touched, is an important part of the prophecies. The prophecies say the Stone of Tear will not fall until the Dragon holds Callandor. The Tairens, who want nothing to do with the One Power, placed Callandor in the Stone to prevent the Dragon from taking it. Rand will have to solve this paradox.\nLan returns with news that almost all the men in the camp shared at least part of Rand's dream. Moiraine now knows which way Rand is heading. Uno reports the valley where Rand caused an earthquake now has another exit. He most likely left that way. Moiraine tells Uno to get his men to Ghealdan and the name of a contact there. They are in no condition for a hard ride. She tells Min to carry a message to the Amyrlin Seat for her. Min first refuses but after Moiraine insists she promises to go. The Aes Sedai asks Loial and Perrin to join her. They agree to do so.\nMoiraine sends them all out of the hut to make preparations. Min asks Lan if he has a message for Nynaeve.

The weddings and the Whitecloaks' behaviour are all the proof she needs. Lan suggests killing Simion to make sure he doesn't talk but Moiraine doesn't think that is necessary this time. She agrees to see Noam.\nSimion takes Perrin and Moiraine to a shed where Noam is locked up. Noam turns out to be a wolfbrother like Perrin. But it seems Noam has turned into a wolf completely. Moiraine looks for any trace of humanity in Noam but can't find it. She can't help him. Knowing this could ultimately be his fate. Perrin sets Noam free so he can die like a free wolf, not a caged one."

His condition is worsening fast. He needs to be healed in Tar Valon soon or Nynaeve fears he'll die. With Dragonmount rearing up in the distance everybody is getting eager to reach the end of their long journey, their tempers are short and the company is uneasy.\nDreams have been troubling Egwene again lately. Nynaeve's weather sense tells her a storm is coming\u2014but of late her weather sense seems more related to people than to the weather. Hurin is worried about some track he saw in the past few days, sniffing a trail he's unsure of. Only Verin seems composed even though she is hip deep in matters of the real world. Very unusual for a Brown.\nSuddenly Nynaeve spots a band of Whitecloaks. Knowing the Whitecloaks will not be friendly to Aes Sedai, Verin tells them to let her do the talking. The leader of the Whitecloaks demands to know where they are coming from and the conversation quickly turns unfriendly. When the Whitecloaks threaten to take them to the Questioners for interrogation, Elayne can hold her tongue no longer and makes herself known. She demands that they let the company past or they'll have Queen Morgase to answer. The Whitecloaks are not impressed, suggesting that the Queen is not as close to Tar Valon as she once was.\nThe leader raises his hand as if to signal his man to attack. Egwene, thinking back of her experiences with the Seanchan, has had enough. She opens herself to the One Power and frightens the leader with a fountain of earth exploding in front of his horse. Elayne and Nynaeve join her much to Verin's astonishment. The leader falls off his horse and the rest of the Whitecloaks make a run for it.\nVerin severly repremands Egwene, Nynaeve and Elayne for disobeying her. Egwene tries to apologize to the Whitecloak and tells him they had a long journey from Falme. After hearing that name the Whitecloak explodes and yells at them that he is Dain Bornhald and Aes Sedai killed his father at Falme. Again Verin is very displeased with Egwene for not guarding her tongue. They leave the Whitecloak where he is and travel on in the direction of Tar Valon, where, according to Verin, \"the real danger begins\"."

She wonders if the Aes Sedai will tell him that. Mat is not very receptive to Selene's offer and she starts to lose her patience. Just as Selene loses her patience she seems to hear something in the corridor. She leaves quickly promising to return and tells Mat to consider his options carefully.\nA few moments after Selene's departure the Amyrlin and the Keeper step into the room. They've come to see how he is doing. Mat assures them he's ready to be on his way. The Amyrlin knows better and the Keeper points out he can barely stand up. They tell him he needs a lot of food for days yet. Mat replies he is fine and not hungry at all. He really should be going. The Aes Sedai don't believe him and tell that if anything he should at least stay as a precaution. They can't be sure yet if they removed all the evil from Shadar Logoth from him. Besides, his description has been passed to the guard. He won't be able to leave Tar Valon.\nTo see if Selene was right Mat remarks his parents probably think he's dead. The Amyrlin offers to make sure a letter reaches them but won't say more. Only when Mat remarks he wouldn't put it past his father to come looking for him the Amyrlin tells him he and Tam al'Thor have indeed been to Tar Valon. Mat is getting very suspicious now and inquires after Rand. The Amyrlin seems to think this is a dangerous topic and asks the Keeper to get Mat some more food. The Amyrlin makes it clear some topics are too dangerous to talk about, even in the Tower. Rand is one, the Horn of Valere is another. She tells him he is tied to the Horn for as long as he lives. Only he can summon the heroes to fight for him. But it will work for the Dark as well. They will try to get the Horn through Mat but if they can't, killing him is an option as well. The Amyrlin means to make sure he is at Tarmon Gai'don to blow the Horn for Rand. With that message she leaves, leaving Mat to consider his options. He is stuck in Tar Valon for the time being it seems, but he's still determined to leave as soon as he gets a chance."

Egwene wanders the Brown corridors alone searching for Verin's study, noting the dusty feel of the air and the minimal decorations. She finds Verin's study cluttered with maps, books, strange instruments of glass and metal and skulls of various shapes and sizes, as well as a pet owl.\nEgwene finds Verin studying what she claims is perhaps the only page to have survived the Breaking, trying to decipher what Rosel of Essam had meant two hundred years after the Breaking when she said that it held secrets the world was not ready to face. The page is a High Chant the reads on about Ba'alzamon and how it is a name hidden within a name. The chant calls Ba'alzamon \"Betrayer of Hope\" and then names Ishamael the Betrayer of Hope. Neither Verin nor Egwene understands its meaning.\nVerin gives Egwene a folder of papers detailing the women who left the Tower with Liandrin, giving any details Verin could find on record, and a list and description of the ter'angreal they took. Verin says she sees no use in the information, and Egwene becomes suspicious that perhaps Verin is also Black Ajah. She waves the thought aside and tells Verin she trusts her.\nVerin then turns the conversation to Dreamers, telling Egwene she is the first Tower Dreamer since Corianin Nedeal four hundred and seventy-three years ago. Verin begins to explain what a Dreamer does to Egwene, drawing first a map of lines representing the Worlds that Might Be. She tells them how these worlds and their very lives are woven into the Pattern of an Age, and how those patterns are further interwoven into the Great Pattern. She then explains how some in the Age of Legends believed that there were still more worlds, overlapping all the Worlds that Might be, and that the Dark One and Creator exist in all worlds simultaneously.\nVerin then tells Egwene that there is a third constant, a world within each of these worlds known as Tel'aran'rhiod, or \"the World of Dreams.\" She then tells Egwene that true Dreamers can enter Tel'aran'rhiod. Verin thinks that the World of Dreams may be a tool Egwene can use to hunt the Black Ajah and gives her a stone ring ter'angreal that Corianin Nedeal claimed allowed easy passage into the World of Dreams. Verin warns Egwene that what happens in the World of Dreams is real and that she must keep the ring secret and sends her off."

Sheriam disregards them and tells Egwene she is late for her test to be raised to Accepted. Sheriam leads her to the hall where the testing ter'angreal is located. Elaida snaps at Egwene when she enters for being late. Sheriam explains that novices are given three chances at taking the test, and if they refuse a third time they are permanently put out of the Tower. Elaida states that Egwene should not be given the chance to take the test, and Sheriam reveals that Elaida demanded to be part of the ceremony.\nEgwene says she will not refuse, and Sheriam warns her that once you begin you must finish or be put out of the Tower, and that to seek inside the ter'angreal is dangerous, that some women never came out. Egwene accepts the test and the ceremony begins. Egwene removes her clothes and worries about the women in the room reading the papers Verin gave her, or discovering the dreaming ter'angreal. She folds the papers and ring inside her clothes and sets them aside by the testing ter'angreal. As soon as she does, Alanna says that there is some sort of resonance, an echo inside the ter'angreal. Alanna tells Sheriam that it is not a problem, and the ceremony begins. After Sheriam and Elaida give the traditional introduction of the candidate, Egwene enters the first arch, the time for what was.\nInside the arch, she finds herself back in the Two Rivers, married to Rand and with a baby daughter named Joiya and studying to replace Nynaeve as Wisdom. Rand tells Egwene that the peddlers bring news of war, of everybody fighting the Seanchan, a people who use Aes Sedai in battle. Rand begins to get a headache, something that has happened more and more frequently, each time growing in pain and bringing strange occurrences. Egwene walks to Rand to attempt to Heal him, and the arch appears. She heads for it and the headache suddenly brings Rand to his knees in pain. He begins screaming for Egwene to help him ease the pain. Egwene tells herself she cannot help and runs through the arch.\nSheriam pours a chalice of water over Egwene's head, washing her clean of what she may have done. She asks Sheriam if what happens was real, and Sheriam responds that noone truly knows if it is real, but the danger is. Egwene then enters the second arch, the arch for what is.\nInside the arch, Egwene finds herself in a fine dress standing in the ruins of the Royal Palace of Andor. The whole city is in ruin, and band of men are running from patrols of Trollocs. A Myrddraal appears, leading the Trollocs in a hunt for some man. She enters the palace and finds Rand pinned beneath a heavy beam. She tells Rand that if she moves the beam, everything will come crashing down and kill them both. Rand says that he could move it himself, but he can't trust himself. He says that he is holding the madness at bay, but he fears that by letting go to move the beam the madness will take him. He tells her to help him by stabbing him in the heart with his dagger. Egwene asks why, and Rand tells her that if he is still alive when the Myrddraal find him they can turn him to the Shadow. The arch appears and Egwene runs to it as Rand screams for her to help him.\nAgain, Sheriam and Elaida wash Egwene clean. Egwene asks Sheriam if Myrddraal and Dreadlords really could have turned a person to the Shadow. Sheriam tells her that thirteen Dreadlords weaving flows through thirteen Myrddraal could turn a channeler to the Shadow, and Egwene notes that thirteen sisters, Liandrin and twelve others, left the Tower as she enters the final arch, the arch for what will be.\nInside the arch, Egwene finds herself wearing the stole of the Amyrlin Seat, with a Keeper raised from the Green Ajah. Her Keeper tells her that the Hall is waiting, and leads her to the Hall of the Tower. Elaida calls for a prisoner to be brought in, and twelve Aes Sedai and two Tower Guards drag in Rand. Elaida states that Rand has proclaimed himself the Dragon Reborn and has channeled the Power, and calls upon Egwene to pronounce the sentence of gentling.\nEgwene refuses to Gentle Rand, and Elaida calls for her to be taken. Her Keeper knocks her unconscious. She awakens in a room full of thirteen Aes Sedai, and thirteen Myrddraal enter the room. Egwene embraces the Source before they can shield her and escapes, noting one of the Black sisters to be Elaida's closest confidante and thus incriminating Elaida as Black Ajah. As she escapes, she comes across her Keeper, stilled, who tells her that Rand has been taken to the Traitor's Court. Egwene is sure that Elaida is now Amyrlin. She tells her Keeper that she never held the Oath Rod and sets off for the Traitor's Court by way of a Tower, noticing Rand about to be Gentled. As she considers what to do, the arch appears. Egwene is still planning to rescue Rand, and she suddenly hears voices shouting they cannot hold it any longer, that it is going wild amidst a woman's orders to hold it. Egwene tears herself away from the balcony and dives through the flickering archway."

The Amyrlin vows to find out what went wrong before leaving.\nSheriam gives Egwene the Great Serpent ring. Egwene thanks Elaida, and Elaida tells her that she did not want her brought forward because she is a wilder, a wilder in spirit and a wilder in ways and that it would have been far better for her to settle for learning how to stay alive. As Egwene is walking with Sheriam and asking what happened, Alanna joins them and tells her the reverberation came back a thousand fold, as if it was trying to shut them off from the Power. Alanna says she will seek punishment from the Amyrlin for not doing what she should have done. She tells Egwene that the only time she has experienced such a reverberation was when a ter'angreal was used in the same room with another one in some way related to it.\nEgwene then asks Alanna what it means to be Green Ajah. Alanna explains that you must love men. She says that they are known as the Battle Ajah and stand ready to face the Shadowspawn armies at Tarmon Gai'don. The Amyrlin then joins the three women. The Amyrlin refuses to allow Alanna to work in the Kitchens, and tells her to talk to Sheriam if she desires punishment, and suggests Egwene get to sleep before leaving them. Sheriam begins to tirade Alanna before noticing Egwene and sends her to bed, warning her to keep her mouth shut.\nEgwene enters Nynaeve's room to find Elayne sobbing into Nynaeve's lap with a Great Serpent ring on her hand. She says that she couldn't be that awful and Egwene breaks down and cries beside her. Nynaeve tells them to hush, and that it will ease with time."

Mat dresses and decides to abandon his spare clothes, but takes his dice. He seems surprised that there is no guard on his room, and looks for a way outside. He finds a way out and walks over to a group of guardsmen. Mat begins talking with one of the bridge guards, asking casually about conditions across the river. The guard informs him that there are Whitecloaks on both sides of the river, but it doesn't matter because a sister had come to the bridges the night before and drilled Mat's description into them and told them he was not to leave the city, let alone the island.\nMat leaves the guard and begins wandering the Tower grounds. He runs into a novice and recognizes her as Else Grinwell, though her manner and behaviour is totally unlike what he remembers of Else. She knows about his healing and tries to avoid him, thinking he may be contagious, and runs off to her work. As he tries and fails to follow her, he catches the sounds of the practice and yard and curiously decides to investigate.\nMat comes upon Warders watching over their students sparring with practice swords, and notices a crowd of Aes Sedai and Accepted watching two particular students spar. Mat realizes that the women are watching Gawyn and Galad practice just as the Warder decides to give them a quick break. Gawyn and Galad catch sight of Mat, and ask him if he's here to learn the sword. Mat replies that he is not and Gawyn says that everyone could do with knowledge of the sword. Mat says the he doesn't need the sword, that he could do fine against both of them with his quarterstaff.\nMat bets Galad and Gawyn that he could beat them both at the same time with a quarterstaff, and they refuse, thinking they would have an advantage because Mat had been sick. The Warder training them, however, takes interest and orders them to the Yard. Mat selects a staff and says \"Luck, time to toss the dice.\" The Warder seems interested that Mat can speak Old Tongue, and Mat realizes he unknowingly spoke it again. Within minutes of commencing the fight, Mat whacks Gawyn on the head and knocks him into a bleeding heap as Aes Sedai rush to attend him, giving Mat angry stares. Mat notes that Galad is better, almost as good at the Warders, but eventually knocks him to the ground and poses for a killing blow, barely stopping himself when he realized what he had been about to do.\nThe Warder then tells them that the greatest Blademaster of all time, Jearom, had been defeated only once, by a farmer with a quarterstaff and that they would do well to remember it. Mat collects his wager from Galad and decides to keep the staff. When the Warder asks, Mat first tells him he's from Manetheren, before correcting himself by saying the Two Rivers. He then hobbles back to the Tower."

Egwene thinks about the two dreams she had, one of the Seanchan and another of Rand reaching for a strange crystal sword as a net fell over him. She dreamed of Rand walking into Shayol Ghul, and of Rand confronting the Seanchan. She had dreamed of Perrin with a falcon and a hawk, both of which Egwene is sure represent women, but the hawk was holding a leash and trying to fasten a collar around Perrin's neck. She also dreamed of Perrin with a beard, leading a pack of wolves. And of Mat, placing his eye on a balance and hanging by his neck from a tree.\nNynaeve growls that the information is useless, and wonders whether or not Verin purposefully gave them useless information. The only pattern Egwene notices is that all of the Ajahs, except the Red, of which Liandrin was the only one, lost two sisters each. Egwene states that everything is random, that none of them were born in the same city, no more than two in the same country, and that they went through a large age range. Egwene then realizes that it is too neat and that the Black Ajah must have had a wide variety to choose from to make so random a pattern and thus there must still be Black sisters in the Tower and elsewhere.\nEgwene notices that thirteen ter'angreal have been stolen, and more than half of them \"use unknown\", last studied by Corianin Nedeal. Four more have some connection to sleep. Another is a long black rod labelled \"DANGEROUS AND ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTROL\" which produces balefire. The women seem suspicious that Verin had not noticed that more than half the stolen ter'angreal had last been studied by Corianin Nedeal.\nEgwene believes that Alanna cannot be Black Ajah, and Nynaeve thinks likewise about Elaida and Sheriam. Egwene decides to try the dreamer ter'angreal that night. As they discuss it, they notice Else standing in the door. Else gives them a message from the Amyrlin telling them what storeroom the stolen ter'angreal had been in. Afraid she cannot keep a secret, Egwene goes chasing after Else. She runs into a woman dressed all in silver and white, who Egwene notes as extremely beautiful, who tells Egwene that she is bold to be alone in the midst of so many murders. The woman tells Egwene that she saw Else running away down a nearby corridor and leaves. Egwene begins to head after Else but quickly turns back to find the women in silver and white has completely vanished."

They decide to find Else later to make sure she does not talk and go to the library to look at the possessions the thirteen Black sisters left behind.\nThe library of the Tower is housed in a building apart from the Tower itself. It holds the largest collection of books in the lands gathered by the White Tower in three thousand years. The three take the entrance that leads directly to the storerooms. The room they are looking for is in one of the lower levels. It does not look like this part of the building is visited frequently. Egwene feels uncomfortable in this quite dark place and thinks the other two do as well.\nNynaeve finds the room they are looking for. The door is locked. Egwene experiments with the One Power to see if she can open it but Nynaeve does not have the patience for that. The only room they have come across in this building to be locked is the one they need to be in. This thought makes her angry enough to channel. Nynaeve breaks the chain with the One Power.\nInside they find a bag of personal possessions for each of the thirteen sisters. Most of it consists of old clothes but each sister had something in their possession that is related to Tear. A book, a note, a picture. It is obvious where the thirteen are headed. Too obvious even. Nynaeve fears it is a trap. They have no idea what to do next but Egwene will try to find an answer in Tel'aran'rhiod, the World of Dreams, that night.

Nynaeve offers to go with her but after some discussion it is decided Egwene will go to Tel'aran'rhiod alone while the other two watch over her sleeping body. After all they don't know if the ring will work for two and there is plenty to look out for in the waking world.\nWhen Egwene falls asleep she finds herself in a hilly area, the landscape is beautiful and the place doesn't seem dangerous at all. But remembering Verin's warning she decided to be cautious anyway. After experimenting with the One Power to see if she can channel in the world of dreams she gets on her way. After taking a step forward she finds herself in an inn. Perrin is there, sleeping in a chair, accompanied by what seems to be a big dog. After a moment Egwene realizes it is wolf not a dog. The wolf gets ready to attack her. Perrin wakes up in time to see Egwene flee before the wolf attacks her.\nShe suddenly finds herself somewhere else. It's dark and she seems to be in a forest. The glow of a campfire is visible through the trees. She heads towards it and finds Rand at the campfire. She steps into the light. Rand doesn't seem to believe it is really her but rather someone sent by the Dark One to kill him. Apparently she isn't the only familiar face he has seen in his dreams. Egwene tries to channel to make him listen but he slices through her weaves easily and threatens her with a sword created with saidin. Egwene flees back to the hills were she started.\nEgwene now tries to focus on her mission. She concentrates on finding answers about the Black Ajah. Suddenly she is in a great hall filled with redstone columns. She meets an extremely ugly servant woman named Silvie there. Silvie talks about Ba'alzamon and the great crystal sword that can be seen in the Hall. Egwene notices that the sword, Callandor, is guarded by a complex weave made of both saidar and saidin. Then footsteps can be heard in the Hall. Someone is coming to look at the sword according to Silvie. Egwene should leave. When she tries though she doesn't seem to be able to get back to the hills. Silvie offers to help, she touches the stone ring and Egwene wakes up in agonizing pain.\nAfter Egwene has calmed down a bit she tells the others what she saw, leaving out only Perrin's wolf. The great hall and Callandor again point to Tear. There is nothing for it but to go there, spring the trap the Black Ajah is setting and see who they can catch. They agree that if the Amyrlin doesn't contact them before midday the following day they will leave. Elayne needs to send a message to her mother, Queen Morgase, though. She can't just run off without notice again. Nynaeve says she knows the perfect messenger."

The result is that both Egwene and Elayne are dragged off by the ear by Laras, leaving Nynaeve to talk to the Amyrlin.\nSiuan tells her she was going to call them to her study but that there is news that couldn't wait. Sheriam has found another Gray Man, or woman in this case, lying dead in her bed. The Amyrlin wants to know if they found out anything. Nynaeve tells her about Else and the things they found in the storeroom but doesn't mention Egwene's visit to the World of Dreams. Siuan tells her she didn't send Else and that all things belonging to the Black sisters had been burnt. This information makes the trap even more obvious.\nNynaeve proposes to spring the trap. The Amyrlin replies she will provide gold for the journey and asks if Elayne will be joining them. It is decided she will. Siuan thinks the conversation has lasted long enough but gives Nynaeve a chance to ask a last question. Nynaeve wants to know what Callandor is. Siuan is visibly shaken by the question. She tells Nynaeve that it is one of the most powerful sa'angreal ever made. The only one who can touch it is the Dragon Reborn, it is one of the signs mentioned in the prophecies. The High Lords of Tear keep it in the Stone to prevent the Dragon from taking it so he cannot break the world again. It is also prophesied that the Stone will not fall until the Dragon holds Callandor. Siuan notes that the Black Ajah could be after one of the other objects related to the One Power stored there but that they must not be allowed to have that particular one.\nBefore leaving, the Amyrlin tells Nynaeve she should make things right with Laras who really is doing a good job running the kitchens. Nynaeve voices her opinion of Laras and the Amyrlin tells her Laras let it be known she thinks the Accepted should have gotten a turn at the lighter jobs so as not to break their spirit. With that she leaves Nynaeve. When Elayne and Egwene return Elayne tells Nynaeve soap tastes horrible and that she hopes the Amyrlin didn't tell them to stay in Tar Valon. Nynaeve replies they'll leave as soon as possible."

When one of the sisters that Healed him, Anaiya, visits him he makes her think he is planning his escape. He also starts asking for more food than he can eat. When the evening comes he simply walks past the Tower guards with all his belongings on his back.\nHe heads for the taverns to gamble and get money for his trip. He knows he is lucky but tonight he wins every toss of the dice. After a while he realizes it must be the influence of the dagger that makes him lucky. He can't remember being this lucky before. A fever grips Mat and he gambles and wins more and more. After almost getting into a fight he leaves a tavern and realizes he's won a fortune.\nIt is now only a few hours before dawn and it is time to leave. On his way to the docks he notices he's being followed. Tar Valon is known as a safe city so Mat is surprised. He hides in a dark alley and the men following him lose him. Mat climbs on the roof of one of the buildings and starts making his way to the docks again. When he wants to descend from the roofs he is attacked again. This time he kills the man by throwing him off the roof. Mat's own fall is broken by the body of his attacker. Mat knows he should be on his way to the docks now.

Thom also looks sad, something that Mat notes as different from when he last saw him. Mat sits down at one of the tables and orders two drinks, one for him and one for Thom, from the serving girl called Saal.\nThom finishes his tale and joins Mat at his table, muttering that the men wanted to hear his tale in Common and not the preferred High Chant. Thom quickly drinks his mug of wine, \"Thom peered into the mug as if surprised to find it empty\", and Mat realises that he is drunk. Saal comes back to the table and berates Mat for giving Thom more wine. Her sister Mada also comes over to the table and tries to get Thom to go to bed, as does Saal. Thom talks about Morgase and Dena, \"Did I ever tell you that two pretty women have loved me in my life?\" Mat orders some chicken and Saal and Mada leave after trying to persuade Thom to eat something.\nMat mentions Rand and Thom is surprised to hear that he is well, \"I am not sure I expected that\". Thom suspects that Rand is the Dragon Reborn but does not say it out loud. When Mat asks why he isn't in Cairhien. Thom talks about killing a man, presumably King Galldrian of Cairhien, and the balance between good and evil.

Red sisters still remember Thom from the gentling of his nephew Owyn and might turn on him. Thom still blames himself for Dena's death and probably feels he hasn't suffered enough for it.\nMat tells Thom that he is leaving Tar Valon for Caemlyn and invites Thom to go with him. Knowing that \"Caemlyn would fit my mood like a glove\", Thom agrees to go with him. He says goodbye to Saal and Mada and leaves the inn with Mat. Mat is surprised to see that the corpse of the footpad is no longer there and knows that \"the city guard would not have carried a dead man away without asking questions\". When Mat mentions footpads to Thom he tells him that there are no footpads in Tar Valon because the Aes Sedai give out harsh punishments.

Mat shows the man the Amyrlin's paper, \"I'm on the business of the Tower\", and tells him that they need to leave on the Gray Gull. Mat and Thom run down the wharf and jump onto the departing boat.\nThe captain, Huan Mallia, tells two of his crew to throw the two men overboard but Mat shows him the paper and gives him a gold coin \"for the inconvenience of our boarding\". He goes on to tell Mallia that they are on White Tower business and that they need to sail for Aringill with all haste. Mallia tells them that all his cabins are full and that they will have to sleep on the deck with the crew. Mat gives him fifteen gold crowns and asks for Mallia's cabin and good food for their journey; Mallia agrees.\nMallia leads them down to his cabin and starts to empty it of his belongings. While he is there Mallia talks to them and asks them questions. He believes that they are messengers to Queen Morgase from the White Tower, \"it was obvious to Mallia that something was afoot between Caemlyn and Tar Valon\", even though Mat and Thom deny it. Mallia is Tairen and talks about his mistrust for Mayene, Illian and the White Tower. He talks about High Lord Samon's views about Aes Sedai. He claims that the White Tower \"meant to crush every nation\" and to avoid that Tairens must hunt down the sisters and kill them. He then leaves the cabin.\nThom and Mat get ready for bed and Mat, on impulse, rolls his dice. Two times in a row he gets the Dark One's Eyes. Thom wants to know where Mat got the money and the Amyrlin's paper from but doesn't believe Mat when he tells him. Thom goes to sleep and Mat thinks about Elayne's letter, luck and footpads. He hears muffled footsteps in the hall and picks up his quarterstaff. The door opens revealing two men with knives; Mat kills both of them with his quarterstaff, \"I've killed three men in one night. Light!\" He then hears footsteps up on the deck and goes up, pretending to be one of the assassins. Mat kills the assassin who is at the tiller and then notices a man trying to sneak up on him; Thom joins him on deck and kills the man. They find a small boat tied to the ship and see that there are two Darkfriends in it. The men recognize Mat and swim for shore in fear of their lives.

Perrin has had troubled dreams since Hopper attacked him but has succeeded \"in keeping live wolves out of his head\".\nThe group has been riding hard since leaving Jarra and have passed through many villages, most bearing signs of Rand's ta'veren influence. Sidon was burnt to the ground when \"a lantern dropped in a barn\" while the spring in Willar had begun flowing again bringing water to the village. In Samaha all the wells went dry overnight and resentments in Tallan \"bubbled to the surface like overflowing cesspits... and it had taken three murders to shock everyone back to his senses\". Crops had failed in Fyall but the Mayor found sacks of gold buried in his garden so nobody would go hungry. Perrin is upset that bad things have happened around Rand but Moiraine explains that \"good and ill are the warp and the woof\" of the Age Lace and that there must be a balance between the two.\nLan leads the group into Remen and tells them that the village has \"had an eventful day or two\". As they ride to the inn they notice that there is a cage holding an Aiel man in the town square. Children are \"pitching stones at him\" and the group are disgusted that the adults are doing nothing to stop them. They arrive at the Wayland's Forge and are greeted by Gainor Furlan the innkeeper. Furlan is surprised to see an Ogier and a lady travelling together.\nFurlan explains the interesting events in the town that Lan had mentioned. Lords Orban and Gann, Hunters of the Horn, and their retainers fought twenty Aielmen. Six of the retainers were killed and the rest injured while the Aiel were killed or fled save the one that was captured. Lan does not appear to believe the story, \"twelve of you fought twenty Aiel?\", probably because Aiel are such good fighters. Perrin is reminded of Min's viewing, \"An Aielman in a cage.

Loial comes into his room a little later, excited that his bed is made of sung wood, to tell Perrin that it is time for supper. Perrin declines and Loial leaves, leaving Perrin to his thinking. Perrin is surprised that the young woman had stared at him when she had \"an Ogier to look at, and Hunters of the Horn in the house, and a Lady visiting\". He thinks about the Aielman and Min's viewing. Perrin believes that he should have stopped the children from throwing rocks at the man and decides that he should do something. He buckles his axe and leaves his room.\nPerrin goes to Moiraine's room in search of Lan but finds that he is not there. He asks Moiraine if Rand caused the battle between the Aiel and the Hunters but Moiraine does not know. She mentions that she has to decide between taking a boat to Illian and another to Tear or continuing across land to Tear. The voyage by boat is quicker, \"If I cannot catch him, I will be in Tear close behind him\", and so they will probably do that. Perrin wants to know if either Moiraine or Lan can sense a Darkfriend and she replies that \"very few humans are so far gone\". Perrin leaves her room and heads outside to the village square.\nPerrin walks to the cage holding the Aielman and lets it down onto the ground. He then opens the door of the cage and tells the Aielman to get out. The man does and tells Perrin that his name is Gaul and he is a Stone Dog.

Perrin realises that he is talking about Rand and tells Gaul to head towards Tear. Suddenly Whitecloaks realise that Gaul is free and attack.

One of her companions is wounded.\nAviendha leads them to her companions, Chiad, Bain, Jolien and Dailin, also Maidens of the Spear. Dailin was wounded in a fight with Cairhienin soldiers. While Nynaeve tends to Dailin's wounds the others discuss various Aiel customs, most of which make very little sense to Egwene. The first-sister bond Chiad and Bain have puzzles her.\nNynaeve makes Dailin drink a mixture of various herbs and gets herself so upset over men with swords and fighting in general that she is able to Heal Dailin with the One Power."

Before they leave Egwene wants to know how the Aiel manage to cross rivers. The Waste has very little water and the idea of swimming seems to frighten the Aiel. Aviendha replies they built a raft to cross the largest river between the Waste and the Andoran border. Egwene is impressed by the way the Aiel deal with situations the haven't encountered before.\nElayne is realizing she doesn't know as much about Aiel as she thought she did. Much to Nynaeve's disliking, she asks them some more questions about their customs. After a while it becomes clearer what the Aiel are doing on this side of the Dragon wall. They are looking for 'He Who Comes With the Dawn', a man who according to the Prophecies will lead the Aiel out of the Waste.\nAfter telling the Aiel they are headed for Tear Nynaeve finally manages to get them on their way. Elayne tells them she thinks 'He Who Comes With the Dawn' is Rand. When Egwene thinks about this she feels Elayne might be right. Before they get the chance to discuss the idea further Egwene is knocked out by a stone from a sling.\nWhen Egwene wakes up she is bound, lying on a horse and in the company of a large number of unwashed men. One of them notices she woke up but before he reaches her she is hit by something again and passes out. When she wakes up for the second time she is unbound and locked up in a building made of logs and rough stone. She overhears a conversation of her captors. It seems the men think they are Aes Sedai and want to sell her. Before she can hear more Nynaeve attracts her attention. Elayne is seriously injured and will not live unless Nynaeve manages to Heal her. After getting very upset first Nynaeve manages to Heal Elayne.\nEgwene, Elayne and Nynaeve now break out of the building. When they step outside they walk straight into a battle between a group of Aiel on one side and their captors and buyers, including three Myrddraal, on the other. The Aiel make short work of the men but the Myrddraal are harder to kill. The girls kill the Myrddraal using the One Power. Nynaeve even uses balefire.\nAfter the battle Nynaeve finds out that the Aiel she Healed died in the fight. She gets very upset over this but the leader of the group, a man named Rhuarc, seems to think it was her time. Aiel are very fatalistic about these things. It turns out Aviendha followed them and saw them being captured. Too far away to do anything about it she went back for help. The Aiel offer to escort them to the nearest town the next day."

After Mat ate all his provisions\u200b and won a fair bit of the men's earnings playing dice, the captain is more than happy to see the last of them. Mat worries a little over the letter Elayne gave him. He read it on the ship, but it did not seem to contain anything important. Still, people were sent after him to kill him in Tar Valon.\nAfter getting off the ship they make their way off the docks. Thom is somewhat shocked by all the refugees and the state they are in. Mat pretends not to care about them. He will help people when they can pay him. He still slips a mother with a child some coins though.\nAfter visiting several inns and spending a lot of gold they find places in a hayloft to sleep and a couple of horses to get to Caemlyn the next day. Mat does not mind the outrageous prices. Gold comes easy as long as he keeps winning dice games. After they had dinner in the stable, Thom and Mat hear a wagon being pulled into the stable by a woman. After a few moments she is followed by a couple of men. From the conversation that follows Mat understands she is an Illuminator cast out by the Guild in Cairhien after the recent accident in their chapter house. The two men are following her because she is still making fireworks and intend to kill her for it.\nMat interferes before they can do so though. Thom is annoyed by this but follows anyway. They knock the men out pretty quickly. The woman, her name turns out to be Aludra, thanks them by giving Mat some fireworks. Mat also offers her some coin but she refuses that saying he must be very young indeed to make such an offer. Thom agrees with her. Before the men wake up again Aludra and Mat and Thom go their separate ways. Thom is not happy about the prospect of a night on the road."

He isn't really interested in the view though. He is merely trying to avoid the scene that is developing behind him. Faile, no her name is Zarine, and Moiraine are on deck as well and the tension between the two is apparent to everybody on board. The crew walks lightly around them. Lan is observing the whole scene with a slight smile on his face though Perrin can't say what he finds so amusing. He feels somewhat responsible for the situation though. Faile and he got in a shouting match a few days earlier in which one of them let it slip Moiraine was an Aes Sedai. Since then the trip became distinctly unpleasant. Loial won't even come out on deck when Faile and Moiraine are there. Perrin doesn't understand how he does it in the heat of Illian. The only good thing about Illian so far is that there are no wolves.\nThe ship docks and the captain, who can't wait to be rid of them, has the horses on shore in no time. He even caught Loial by surprise. The Ogier comes hurrying of the ship still trying to get his coat on. Moiraine now tells Faile it is time to say goodbye. Faile refuses to leave them though. She is still convinced they will lead her to the Horn. She says nothing Moiraine or Lan are willing to do will stop her from going with them. Moiraine now gives up trying to make Faile leave. Instead she demands that Faile swears on her Hunter's Oath to do as Moiraine says, not to leave them, do nothing to endanger the company and not to ask questions. Faile takes that Oath.\nMoiraine tells Perrin he has found Min's falcon and that despite Moiraine's best efforts she seems determined to perch on his shoulder\u200b. A ta'veren at work. She is his responsibility now. Faile and Perrin protest loudly. Faile says she is nobody's responsibility and Perrin says he didn't ask her to come. Protests are useless with Moiraine though. Faile wants to know who Min is and if he is indeed a ta'veren. He refuses to answer her but instead hoists her on the back of his horse.

People seem to be familiar with Ogier but Loial doesn't seem at ease anyway. Nor for that matter are the people in Perrin's company. Something seems wrong with Illian but Perrin can't say what it is. Perrin asks Loial if there will be Ogier in the city. Loial says he fears there may be. Ogier from his own stedding even. Perrin tries to comfort him by saying Moiraine wouldn't let the Ogier take him. Loial seems to agree since she may need to travel the Ways again. Perrin notices Faile is paying close attention and he tries to warn the Ogier not to say anymore. The Ogier doesn't seem to notice but the only thing he adds is that he feels there is something wrong with Illian.\nThey go to an inn called Easing the Badger. Perrin has no idea what is meant by that. Must be a story he doesn't know. There is music in the inn and a girl with a very low-necked blouse singing and dancing on one of the tables. The song is familiar to Perrin but the words are not. The innkeeper, a woman named Nieda, knows Moiraine as Mistress Mari. She and Moiraine seem to know each other and Nieda tells her some things that have been going on. There have been an unusual number of fights in the inn, which is why Nieda hired the singer. A new lord has been installed in the Council of Nine. Nobody seems to know much about him. Strangely enough Nieda has had some disturbing dreams about him. The council have also forbidden ships to leave the port for Tear, a traditional enemy of Illian. Moiraine is disturbed by what she hears. Perrin can even smell fear on her.\nThey take rooms in the inn and a little while later they are all having dinner in the common room. Loial heard the Ogier in the city suddenly left during the winter but nobody seems to know why. Again nobody seems to feel comfortable in Illian. Perrin is tense, excited. After a moment he realizes he feels like a wolf just before a fight. During the dinner Perrin smells wrongness. He has smelled it before in Remen but he can't identify it. The Aes Sedai and Warder don't seem alarmed though. They can sense Shadowspawn if they get too close. Then he sees six ordinary looking men enter the inn. He realizes the smell is coming from them and that they carry knives. Perrin yells out a warning to the others and tears the leg off a chair to defend himself. The men seem to be after him. The Warder, the Ogier, Faile, they are all obstacles for them. The fight is over in seconds and all six lie dead on the floor. Lan and Moiraine recognize them as Gray Men.\nMoiraine has given away she is Aes Sedai in the fight. While the innkeeper gets rid of the body Moiraine sees she has ignored the ta'veren Perrin and Mat too long in favour of Rand. She makes a decision to go out into the city to get information. She tells Lan to stay with the others much to his disliking."

Lan decides to check out the surroundings of the inn and asks Perrin to join him. Loial and Faile end up joining them. Lan is not sure what he is looking for but he will know it when he sees it.\nOutside the four of them look around for a while. None of them really knows what to look for. The only thing Perrin notices is a faint smell of burnt sulphur. He notices Lan looking at something and goes to join him. The smell of burnt sulphur is stronger here. Lan is looking at prints of what seems to be a giant dog. Only dogs don't leave prints on stone.\nLan tells them the prints are from a Darkhound. It was probably looking for something and went back to report now that it has found it. Faile mutters something about Shadowspawn and Lan again tries to discourage her from following them. It doesn't work. Perrin wants to know why neither Lan nor Moiraine sensed the Darkhound. Lan doesn't know for sure but he does know that his Aes Sedai is in danger if she can't sense it. He decides to follow her and tells the others to get some sleep while they can as they probably won't stay the night in Illian.\nPerrin takes the Warder's advice and goes to bed. He dreams a wolfdream again but a very confused one this time. He tries to find Hopper but first he only sees Mat playing dice with Ba'alzamon. He tries to warn Mat but the scene suddenly changes. Hopper is finally there. Perrin asks why he had to see the meeting between Lanfear and Ba'alzamon or Moonhunter and Heartfang as Hopper calls them. He also wants to know whether what he sees is real or not. Hopper doesn't give him a straight answer even when Perrin tells him he is being hunted by Gray Men and Darkhounds, the Notdead and Shadowbrothers to Hopper. The only thing he will tell him is that the Last Hunt is coming and Perrin has to flee the Darkhounds. With that message ringing in his ears Perrin wakes up.\nFaile is watching him when he wakes up.

Before they leave Moiraine tells them Sammael sent the Darkhound but not the Gray Men she seems to think there is more than one Forsaken at work in Illian tonight. Perrin doesn't understand it. They are all Darkfriends, why don't they work together against Rand, the Dragon Reborn. He immediately realizes he shouldn't have said that. Moiraine tells Faile there is no way back now. The Aes Sedai tells Nieda to leave the city and take everybody she loves with her.\nWhen they leave the city it is raining but the rain turns to a drizzle soon and then stops altogether. Lan says this not a good thing for them as Darkhounds don't like rain. Soon after they leave the city they can hear the Darkhounds calling each other. Moiraine is scanning the hills around them looking for something. Perrin wants to know why they aren't moving. The Darkhounds are a long way off yet. Lan says not even the fastest horse can outrun them. They'll have to face the Darkhounds. Moiraine finds a good spot where they can make their stand and Perrin prepares his bow. Lan says it probably won't do them much good but maybe he can kill one.\nThe Darkhounds come nearer quickly. Perrin shoots as soon as the pack of ten is within bowshot. It takes him three arrows to kill one though and they are approaching fast. Moiraine kills the remaining nine with the One Power. Faile wants to know what the Aes Sedai did. She only says it was something forbidden. Whatever is going on in Illian tonight, they were not Sammael's main concern. Merely an annoyance. Perrin wonders if the Forsaken was after Rand. Moiraine says it could be Mat as well. He blew the Horn of Valere after all. Faile is shocked to hear the Horn has been found already. Moiraine cuts off the discussion. It is time to get moving.

The man addressed as Great Master doesn't want to interfere directly, his opponent will find out, so he gives Comar orders to have all three killed. Comar says he will take care of it personally.\nMat makes his way into the palace while he wonders what the three of them are doing in Tear. Inside he runs into an officer of the Guard. Before the man can speak Mat tells him he has a letter from Elayne. The officer wants to know how Mat managed to get into the palace.

Mat swears he is a loyal Andorman and that he would follow Morgase and Gaebril anywhere. For some reason this doesn't seem to please Tallanvor. He takes Mat to see the Queen though.\nWhen Morgase reads the letter her response is mixed. Pride at Elayne being raised to Accepted so soon but also anger at the lack of information. Mat wants to tell Morgase what he overheard in the garden but Lord Gaebril silences him. Mat recognizes his voice as the voice of the 'Great Master'. It seems luck is with him again.

She gives Mat a message for the next time he sees Elayne. She says she will not remove her from the Tower before time. Mat says he means to return to his father's farm but Morgase seems to doubt that. Gaebril gives him a heavy purse and tells him to go see something of the world before he goes back to milking his father's cows.

              "pov_summary": "The Darter arrives in Tear. Not a moment too soon for Egwene who is seasick. At least she has it somewhat under control. Nynaeve is throwing up every ten minutes. Egwene looks at the city dominated by the ancient fort called the Stone. She thinks about her recent expedition into the World of Dreams but nothing she saw makes much sense. The same goes for her regular dreams. Why is Master Luhhan being used as bait by the Whitecloaks? Why does Perrin have to choose between a hammer and an axe? And why does he have a falcon perched on his shoulder? Why does Mat keep yelling \"I am coming\"? Why is Rand being stalked by six men and five women?\nCaptain Canin tells her they have arrived and that he will have the horses put on the dock as soon as possible. He is happy to be rid of his sick passengers. Elayne and Nynaeve appear on deck and hurry to get their things. They'll be just as glad to be off the boat as Egwene is. The tension between Egwene and Nynaeve has not eased on the trip to Tear. Both are still irritable. Once they are on the docks the question is what to do next?\nObviously they need to find the inn the Black sisters are staying in. Elayne suggests hiring a thief-taker. That seems like a good idea to the three of them. Egwene suggests finding an inn but Nynaeve objects that the inns are probably watched. They need to find another place to stay. They debate other options for a bit. Nynaeve has an idea and without telling them what she intends she walks to one of the stores where herbs are sold.\nA stout woman with gray hair opens the door. She is very careful at first. Everything connected with the One Power is suspicious in Tear. It wouldn't be the first time Wise Women became the victim of that mistrust. Nynaeve tells her she needs something to settle her stomach and Mother Guenna invites them in. While the Wise Woman makes a tea for Nynaeve's stomach the two exchange knowledge on medicinal herbs. Egwene is getting annoyed with Nynaeve. It's not like they will need that in the Tower. Elayne, who has had enough of the arguing now asks if Mother Guenna has a cure for people who can't stop arguing. It turns out she does but neither Egwene nor Nynaeve wants to try that.\nNynaeve wants to know if Mother Guenna has a spare room they can rent. The Wise Woman says she may but she does want to know what brought them to Tear in the first place. Nynaeve tells her they are chasing Darkfriends who have taken some old, not particularly valuable things from them. Mother Guenna wants to know why they didn't bring any men. This kind of thing is one of the few things they are good for according to her. Nynaeve tells her there was no one but them to go. Mother Guenna draws her own conclusions and Nynaeve doesn't correct her. She agrees to let them stay and goes out to get a man who can help them.\nWhen she is gone Egwene remarks Nynaeve is manipulating people as well as Moiraine is. Nynaeve turns white at the comparison between Moiraine, a woman she intensely hates, and herself. Elayne gets up and slaps Egwene in the face. This time she has gone too far. If they are to achieve anything they'll have to stop arguing and do what they must. Egwene knows Elayne is right but she still doesn't like it."

He tells them he will help them but that the High Lords may have work for him soon. He has seen people on the roofs from the corner of his eye. There are thieves active in Tear. Nynaeve wants to know what he charges. After they settle on a price she tells Juilin she just wants him to find them. They will do the retrieving of the artifacts themselves. She also stresses how extremely dangerous the women he will be looking for are. When she is satisfied he understands she starts to describe them. Egwene gets the impression Juilin could recite each word back to them after she is done.\nAfter Juilin departs they spend the rest of the day in the house reading. Nynaeve is uneasy because she feels a storm coming. When it is time to sleep Egwene tries the ring again. Once in the world of dreams she makes her way to the Stone.

Thom is developing a cough that is getting worse as the night grows older. He tries to convince Mat again to go back after they have marched past three inns without Mat noticing. Mat wants to try one more before they go.\nThey step into the Golden Cup and Mat spots Comar almost immediately. They talk to the innkeeper for a bit and find out he is probably cheating at the dice game he is playing. Mat steps up to him and puts a gold coin on the table. Comar dices with him but Mat feels the dice tumbling in his head. Even with the loaded dice he still wins. He tells Comar to leave Tear and tell Gaebril anything he wants as long as he leaves the girls alone. A surprised Comar reveals himself and then draws a sword. In the fight that follows he breaks his back. Before he dies he tells Mat he is not alone and that the girls won't live much longer. At least he hasn't found them yet.\nMat and Thom are shoved out of the inn by the innkeeper and Mat finally realizes they need some sleep. On the way back Mat realizes his luck works best at random things. They will have to randomly search inns if they want to find the girls. At dawn they are back out searching though. Thom's cough has grown worse. They hear a lot of rumours that day. One even more unlikely than the next. But no trace of Elayne, Egwene and Nynaeve. Mat won't give up though, he has a wager to win."

Channeling is outlawed in Tear though Aes Sedai are allowed to enter. Perrin smiles at the breeches the men in Tear wear but Loial remarks there is nothing to laugh about. The people of Tear look defeated. Once Loial mentions it Perrin sees it too.\nLan leads them to a simple inn between a weaver and a blacksmith. They take rooms there and Moiraine tells them to stay close to the inn while she goes out to gather information. Once Perrin has put his stuff in his room, both Faile and Loial are gone.

After Perrin has shown he knows his way around the smithy, the smith, Dermid Ajala, lets him work on some of the orders he has received. All of his apprentices have run off, complaining about the bad dreams they have been having.\nPerrin loses himself in the work. When he finally looks up Faile is watching him. She remarks he really is a blacksmith's apprentice. Ajala replies for him and says he should be a master by now. He will take Perrin on as an apprentice if he wants. Faile wants to know if this is really what he wants to do with his life. Perrin says this is what he wants to do someday, but not yet. The smith gives him a hammer he has been using as payment and a reminder of that someday. Back in his room Perrin puts the hammer with the axe. The axe is several pounds lighter but feels a lot heavier.\nLan comes to get him, Moiraine is back and they need to make plans. Moiraine tells them one of the Forsaken, Be'lal, is in Tear posing as High Lord Samon. This time there is no running, they will have to fight. Moiraine thinks Be'lal is planning on luring Rand to the Stone and having him take Callandor. He then plans to take Callandor and kill Rand with it. This plan would fit with what little Loial and Moiraine know of Be'lal. Moiraine and Lan are going to try to make their way into the Stone and kill Be'lal.

While he is distracted, he is attacked by a small group of Aiel, whom he tries to fight back, but they trap him. The Aiel want to know why Mat is watching the Stone, and another voice speaks up, saying that he wants to know why the Aiel have been watching the stone; it is Juilin, who has also been sneaking around the rooftops. When the Aiel pose the same question to Juilin, he says, \"I...did a thing today that...troubles me\". One of the Aiel introduces himself as Rhuarc, and we learn a bit later on in the chapter that another one is Gaul, the Aielman that Perrin rescued earlier from a cage. When asked again why he is there, Mat tells the Aiel and Juilin that some friends of his are in the Stone as prisoners and that he means to rescue them. The Aiel leave and Juilin offers to help Mat; he says that he can get Mat into the Stone by pretending to be taking Mat, as a prisoner, to the cells.\nMat, unsure of whether or not to trust Juilin, tells the other man to wait for him and walks along the top of the wall that leads to the Stone. When he reaches the Stone, he shoves the bundle of fireworks into an arrow slit and lights the fuses. The fireworks blow a big hole in the wall, which surprises Mat, who had only been hoping to cause a distraction. For a moment, he tries to decide whether he should trust Juilin and go back or just go through the hole he has created, and finally he enters the Stone on his own. Inside, he meets at least ten Defenders of the Stone and begins to fight them, knowing that he can't beat them all. However, Juilin shows up, obviously having followed Mat, and joins him in defeating the Defenders.

The man asks Rand if he remembers who he is, and if he remembers anything. Rand demands a name of him, and the man introduces himself as Be'lal. Be'lal urges Rand to take Callandor and fight him, calling a black sword made of saidin into his own hands, but Rand is unsure if he can actually take Callandor and instead creates a sword of fire to use against the Forsaken.\nRand and Be'lal begin to fight, but Be'lal is very obviously the more skilled of the two. As they fight, Be'lal taunts Rand about whether or not he can remember anything of the Age of Legends and War of the Shadow, urging him again to take Callandor to see if it will prolong his life. Rand still refuses to do so. As they fight, the old wound in Rand's side begins to open. He is losing the battle.\nThere are others fighting in the chamber as well, Defenders against Aiel, but Rand barely notices them until he trips over a dead body. Before Be'lal can kill Rand, Moiraine arrives and kills him with a bar of white fire (Balefire). With Be'lal now dead, Moiraine tells Rand to take Callandor. She explains to Rand that Be'lal had meant to kill him for it, but that Callandor is Rand's birthright.\nSuddenly, whips of black lightning curl around Moiraine, who screams as she is thrown against one of the columns in the chamber. Ba'alzamon is there, and tells Rand that he is going to take his soul. He begins to do so, but Rand desperately throws himself towards Callandor and seizes the sword which, as a sa'angreal, enormously increases the amount of saidin that he can wield. He faces Ba'alzamon and tells him that he is going to finish him off once and for all. Faced by Rand holding Callandor, Ba'alzamon flees and disappears suddenly.

She begins to look inside them, but they are all empty, since she is in Tel'aran'rhiod and not the waking world.\nOutside one of the cells, Egwene sees a shape flickering in and out of existence. It is Amico Nagoyin, who, in the waking world, is drifting toward sleep and obviously playing with a dream ter'angreal as she does so. Egwene cuts her off from the Source and ties her with flows of air, trapping her in Tel'aran'rhiod, and Amico screams. Her figure is very insubstantial, though Egwene does not know why. She ties the Black sister up in flows of air, breaks the lock on the door next to her and swings the door open. She then steps out of Tel'aran'rhiod and wakes up back in the cell with Elayne and Nynaeve. Nynaeve tells her that they heard someone scream outside, and Egwene replies that it was Amico and that they should be able to leave now. Elayne, however, informs Egwene that they are still shielded, though the shield seems somewhat more insubstantial. She does not know why. It is likely because Amico was only half asleep and therefore not fully in Tel'aran'rhiod when Egwene shielded and trapped her, so some part of Amico's own shields against the three girls are still in place. Egwene decides that she will have to go to sleep again and try once more."

They are very surprised to see him, and Nynaeve demands to know why he is there. Mat replies that he is there to rescue them. Nynaeve and Elayne wake up Egwene, who also demands to know why Mat is there; none of them thank him for coming to rescue them. When they see Juilin standing behind him, they glare, but Juilin tells Mat that they have plenty of cause, as he betrayed them, even though it was really Liandrin's doing.\nThey all leave the cell, and Nynaeve swings a fist at Amico, knocking her off the bench; Mat is astounded that they would hit a defenseless woman, but the girls tell him not to interfere in what he doesn't understand. Mat wants to leave the Stone of Tear immediately, but Egwene, Elayne and Nynaeve refuse to leave; instead, they insist on hunting down the Black Aes Sedai and walk away.

Somehow, without knowing how, Rand manages to fix everything, restoring the balance and making things right.\nThey re-enter the Heart of the Stone. Rand sees black cords running from Ba'alzamon into the blackness; Rand severs them and Ba'alzamon convulses, dwindling and growing larger at the same time, as if there are two of him.

The Great Lord of the Dark can never be defeated!\" Rand pulls Callandor free, and Ba'alzamon's body falls.\nSuddenly, Rand is no longer in Tel'aran'rhiod, but back in the real Heart of the Stone, surrounded once more by fighting men. He sees Moiraine still lying on the floor, unconscious. At Rand's feet lies the body of a dead man, Ba'alzamon. Rand thinks to himself, \"I have killed Ba'alzamon, killed Shai'tan!

Mat is contemplating the people in the streets and the recent events, while Rhuarc reads a book and the women sit at a table.\nNynaeve asks Moiraine about Perrin, and Moiraine replies that, the last she knew, Perrin was alive and well, though he might have put himself into considerable danger trying to rescue his \"companion\" (Faile). Egwene wants to know who his companion is and Nynaeve wants to know what kind of danger, but Moiraine tells them that it doesn't concern them, and that she will check in on Perrin and his companion soon. She says that she has delayed only to show them something, and pulls one of the seals of the Dark One's prison from her pouch; it is unbroken. Nynaeve comments on its unbroken state, but then mentions that it doesn't matter now (since the Dark One is supposedly dead). Moiraine insinuates that it does matter.\nMat breaks in, and asks \"how all of this can be\": the Stone of Tear has fallen, while the Prophecies of the Dragon say that it will not fall until the arrival of the People of the Dragon. Mat wants to know if they, Lan and the few hundred Aiel who took the Stone are the People of the Dragon. Rhuarc reveals to them the secret that an ancient name for the Aiel is \"People of the Dragon\". Mat is now satisfied that the Prophecies truly have been fulfilled, and that it is all done now. Egwene contradicts him, reminding him that the Forsaken are on the loose, and Nynaeve adds that the Black Ajah is also still at large. Mat clarifies that he meant that the hardest part is done; \"The Stone has fallen to the People of the Dragon, Rand has Callandor, and Shai'tan is dead.\"\nWhen Mat speaks the Dark One's name, Moiraine snaps at him to be quiet, calls him a fool, and reveals that the Dark One is not dead: when Rand killed Ba'alzamon, Ba'alzamon left behind a dead, human body. Therefore, it wasn't the Dark One that Rand killed. Mat wants to know who Ba'alzamon was, if not the Dark One; Elayne is aghast, having thought that the Forsaken were all they had left to worry about; Nynaeve is confused, since Rand is certain that he killed the Dark One, and she also wants to know who it was that Rand killed. It is Egwene who thinks that she might have the answer to that question. She mentions a page from an old book that Verin showed her, one that mentioned Ba'alzamon and Ishamael together. She suggests that perhaps Ba'alzamon was Ishamael, and Moiraine agrees that it is possible, but that if it was, at least nine of the thirteen Forsaken are still alive to be defeated. She also reminds them all that three of the seven seals are broken, so only four stand between the Dark One and the world.\nMat notices that Egwene, Elayne and Nynaeve all look determined, and realizes that they mean to continue on fighting the Black Ajah, the Forsaken and the Dark One. He thinks to himself, \"Well, they needn't think I am going to come pull them out of the soup pot again\".\nThe door opens and a beautiful woman enters the room. She flourishes a piece of folded parchment while stating that she is not used to being given messages to carry. When Moiraine asks who she is, the woman introduces herself as Berelain, First of Mayene. Moiraine opens the letter, and then asks why Berelain delivered it, if she is unused to being a messenger. Berelain replies that the woman who gave it to her was very impressive. She then smiles at Rhuarc, inquiring if he is the leader of the Aielmen who took the Stone. She tells him that she might ask him to dine with her one day soon. She then tells Moiraine to inform the Dragon Reborn that the First of Mayene will dine with him that night, and then leaves.\nMoiraine reads the letter aloud to the others. It is a letter from Lanfear: \"Lews Therin was mine, he is mine, and he will be mine, forever. I give him into your charge, to keep for me until I come.\"\nMoiraine then reminds Mat that he is ta'veren, the sounder of the Horn of Valere no less, and that nothing is done for him yet. Nynaeve is looking at him sadly, Egwene looks as if she has never seen him before, Elayne looks as if she expects him to change into someone else, and Rhuarc looks at him with a certain amount of respect. Mat tells them that he understands and that they can count on him, all the while wondering how soon Thom will be fit to travel, and thinking to himself that it is time to run.\nOutside, people are still crying Rand's name: \"The Dragon! Al'Thor! The Dragon! Al'Thor! The Dragon! Al'Thor! The Dragon!\""

Moiraine had given her a message for the Amyrlin's ears alone, and was told to keep out of notice until she is in the Amyrlin's study; for this reason, she is wearing a dress, and has her hair longer than it was when she last visited the Tower; also, she uses her full name, Elmindreda, so that nobody will recognize her by name.\nAs she enters the Tower, she is greeted by an Accepted, Faolain, whom she had met briefly during her previous visit. However, the Accepted does not recognize her. Min requests the right to speak to the Amyrlin, and gives her full name, Elmindreda, praying that it will be recognized. In the middle of the request, however, three Aes Sedai walk into the room, and she sees a different aura around each of them - and each aura indicates that each of them will die, and all on the same day. She is shaken. Faolain goes to deliver the message to the Keeper.\nMin continues to see auras around the Aes Sedai and Gaidin who enter the room, and is even more scared when she sees that Sheriam will be hurt on the same day that many people of the Tower die. A few moments later, Min is greeted by a novice, Sahra, and is led to the Amyrlin's study. On the way, she sees more auras of death and injury.\nOutside the Amyrlin's study, Min runs into Gawyn who is concerned about Elayne, Egwene, and Nynaeve - he has not been told about their whereabouts, except that they are serving penance on a farm. Min sees an aura of his sigil of the White Boar on a green background, rather than the red one of Andor. Min assures Gawyn that they must be safe, and enters the antechamber of the Amyrlin's study.\nThe Keeper of the Chronicles, Leane, recognizes Min, despite her disguise, and sends her into the Amyrlin's room.\nMin sees an aura of the Siuan lying naked on the ground, and also has a feeling that something else is wrong, yet she cannot explain it. The Amyrlin laughs the vision off, and Min speaks about all her visions since entering the Tower. Siuan then tells Min about the Black Ajah in the Tower, and Min is frightened. Yet Siuan changes the topic to that of Min's reason for coming to the Tower, and Min in turn relays Moiraine's message that Rand is traveling to Tear. Siuan is angry, and believes that it is too soon for him. Siuan also manages to worm out the fact that Min is in love with Rand and that she wants to go to Tear to be with him. However, Siuan had been plotting since Min stepped into the room, and intends for Min to stay as bait for the Black Ajah. Siuan insists that Min keep Elmindreda as her name, and gives her the story of trying to decide between two suitors as her reason to stay in the Tower."

Nynaeve interrupts, saying that the Dragon was reborn, and that the Pattern would not accept another Dragon. Egwene, however, ushers the other woman to continue. Joiya begins speaking again. Rand al'Thor would be blamed for the things the impostor did. The countries would unite against him, crushing him, and he would be destroyed. Tarmon Gai'don would arrive, and the Dark One would win with no Dragon to face him.\nEgwene thinks about their two answers, and decides that Amico's is more plausible. At that moment, Moiraine strides in, her face a thunderhead, with Elayne following."

              "pov_summary": "Moiraine is angry with Rand and Elayne watches an exchange between the Aes Sedai and Nynaeve about how 'mule-headed' Two Rivers men are. Nynaeve is obviously satisfied that Moiraine is unable to influence Rand to do what she wishes. Elayne finds herself trying to head off the argument. Egwene asks Moiraine why she is so angry with Rand and instead of answering, Moiraine turns her attention to Joiya and Amico, whom Nynaeve and Egwene are in the process of questioning. Elayne is afraid of Joiya, who, she realizes, is not bound but is at least shielded from the True Source. She observes that Nynaeve and Egwene seem to be no more afraid of Joiya than Moiraine is and admits to herself that sometimes she finds it difficult to be brave and wishes she could be as bold as the others.\nElayne notices that for the first time Moiraine is not all cool and calm as normal and seems 'out of herself' and visibly needs to regain her composure. She is also aware that had it been Egwene or Nynaeve who were off balance, Joiya would have taunted them and tried to make them more upset, but with Moiraine, Joiya is plainly uneasy. Moiraine tells Joiya that she has made arrangements for her and Amico to be taken to Tar Valon in four days and threatens her with the Traitor's Court unless she can come up with something new to say. Amico seems to be terrified of Moiraine and once released from the bonds that had been holding her, drops to the floor in a curtsy in front of her. Nynaeve is angry with Moiraine for not taking more time to help question Joiya and Amico and because she has now decided to send them back to Tar Valon. Moiraine and Nynaeve argue. Nynaeve loses her temper with Moiraine telling her not to interfere in the task of chasing the Black Ajah that the Amyrlin has set them. Moiraine seems to be dangerously cool and looks as though she will teach Nynaeve a lesson about holding her tongue. Elayne feels that she has fallen into the role of peacemaker between the others. Elayne realises that she is, potentially, stronger than Moiraine, but that some of the things Moiraine does with the Power still amaze her. She is also aware that there are things that she, Egwene and Nynaeve can do that Moiraine cannot.\nElayne feels that she is betraying Egwene because of her feelings for Rand but she is upset because Berelain was in Rand's chambers. Moiraine apologizes to Egwene that she had to be told about Berelain. Egwene realizes how Elayne feels and admits to Elayne that she loves Rand like a brother and Elayne as a sister and wishes them well with each other. Elayne is surprised but relieved. Egwene shocks everyone by asking Moiraine if she has ever been in love. Moiraine then surprises them further by telling them she has a better idea who she will marry than either Egwene or Elayne. Moiraine then seems to regret speaking and tells them that she meant only to share an ignorance. She tells Nynaeve that she would not choose Lan.\nMoiraine and Elayne tell Egwene and Nynaeve that Rand had almost died when a bubble of evil passed through the Stone, but that he is Healed. She also explains that Rand cannot at the moment stop these things from happening but that in time he will be better equipped to deal with them. Elayne feels that Moiraine's reaction to the whole incident is cold. Moiraine is angry with Rand because he will not move on from Tear and that the Forsaken will see his inaction as a sign of weakness. She tells the girls that she wants Rand to go after Sammael and for Tear to go to war against Illian. Nynaeve does not agree with her but Elayne suddenly comprehends that sometimes unpleasant things have to be done because the price of not doing them is worse. Moiraine is sympathetic towards her over this. Elayne realizes what Nynaeve doesn't - that war will come anyway, whether Rand begins it or not. Nynaeve is visibly shaken by this and Egwene is horrified at the understanding. Moiraine tells them that Rand is reading all of the Prophecies of the Dragon to see what they say to help him decide what to do and that she is worried that one of the Forsaken will have him before he has made up his mind. Nynaeve is more gentle about it, explaining to Moiraine that he is only trying to find his way. Moiraine is not affected and tells the girls that she will do what she must. Egwene and Elayne demand that she tell them what she intends.\nMoiraine tells the girls about the Tairen Great Holding and the twisted doorway ter'angreal that is there. She tells them that she may step through it, but Elayne notices that she does not seem eager to do so. Nynaeve says that they had been there to see if Liandrin or the others had taken anything and Elayne says that she had seen the doorway when they were there. Elayne and Egwene immediately think of uses for it as soon as Moiraine tells them what it does. Moiraine is exasperated and tells them about the rules of using the doorway and the dangers. Nynaeve demands to know how Moiraine knows all this so she tells them how it used to be the property of the First of Mayene. Moiraine then advises the girls to concentrate on Tanchico and that she had sent pigeons to the Amyrlin and also reminds them of their status and then leaves them.\nElayne asks Egwene again if she meant what she said about Rand and that she often wondered if the jokes Min had made about them sharing him had been a viewing she hadn't told them about. She tells Egwene that she still believes that Rand is in love with Egwene. She is full of despair and thinks her mother will disapprove of him as well. Egwene tries to comfort her by reminding her about the reports of her mother's affair with Lord Gaebril. Nynaeve rejoins them and surprises them both by knowing exactly what they've been talking of and asking Elayne what she means to do about Berelain and if she's even sure she wants to go to the trouble because of what Rand will become. Elayne retorts that it doesn't matter and that she loves him regardless. Nynaeve is happy with her response and says she had to be sure. But still wants to know what Elayne plans for Berelain. Elayne declares she still doesn't know and she believes that Rand doesn't even know she exists. Nynaeve then asks what Elayne will do when they have to part, if Rand asks her to stay and she says she will still leave because she has duties and wants to become Aes Sedai. Elayne thinks the others would think her silly for worrying about Rand when they are searching out the Black Ajah and Nynaeve reassures her."

Elayne is dragging her feet about seeing Rand, she is all dressed up and Egwene is deliberately plainly attired. Rand's quarters are being guarded by six Aiel and they ask admittance to investigate Rand's wounds. Gaul informs them that Rand is in a foul mood and has already thrown out a group of High Lords that morning and actually physically shoved Torean down the hall. Egwene sees this as a change in him. He was not usually a violent person. Once they enter his rooms Egwene looks for more changes in him and finds them. His once open face was harder and he looked much more like an Aiel. He thinks Moiraine has sent them. They tell him that she did not and they came to help him with channeling. Rand is suspicious but Elayne convinces him to at least give it a try. Egwene embraces saidar and asks Rand if he notices anything. He feels nothing and asks if she is really channeling and she is holding as much of the Power as she can manage. She rates her channeling against Moiraine's for the first time and realises that she is the stronger. Egwene then reaches out with the Power to Rand's wound and describes it as evil festering.\nThis is when Rand realises he feels goosebumps when women channel. At first he thinks its because he is nervous around channeling women but Egwene thinks not and tests him again to see if he feels them. Then they ask him to embrace saidin but the girls cannot sense anything. He proves to them that he is channeling by pinching Egwene so Elayne pinches him back. Rand lifts them up using the Power and they cannot feel anything holding them. Egwene tries to embrace the Source and realises that he has shielded them as well. He starts to do other things and move random objects with the Power. Some of the moving objects burst into flames and he extinguishes the flame by spreading out the heat, much to their surprise, he then releases saidin. Egwene realises that Rand is much stronger than she is when he demonstrates his use of the Power. They discuss how each of them goes about embracing the Source and start to realise the differences between men and women channeling and in saidin and saidar. That women have to surrender to the Source whilst men struggle to grasp it and constantly fight it and how each uses the flows differently to do the same thing. Elayne remembers and incident in her training where she tried to do what Rand did with the flames and was burnt.\nEgwene tells Rand she doesn't love him anymore and her feelings have changed and that she loves him more like a brother. He says his have changed too although Egwene thinks he is just trying to hide his disappointment."

She asks him if he was very hurt by what Egwene has said and what he tells her makes her relieved that he won't long for Egwene. He offers to make her a flower using the Power and some feathers but he cannot embrace saidin to change the feathers and throws them to the floor offering her cloth instead. Elayne is surprised to find that she trusts him to use saidin in her presence particularly after what he just did to them. She takes the feathers he dropped as a keepsake and accepts the silk saying she is sure the majhere can have something made from it. She asks Rand if he likes her and is frustrated as he seems not to know what she means. Finally he says that he is fond of her too. She is still inwardly worrying about Berelain so she tells him she wants him to kiss her. He is surprised and doesn't know how to react but she taunts him about his shock and he kisses her. He asks her if she and Egwene schemed this between them and she manages to appear shocked. She asks him if he is sorry for the pinch and he is honest and says that they deserved it. She Heals where she pinched him for telling her the truth.\nGaul interrupts them with the arrival of the Tairen Lords and Elayne goes to leave telling Rand to think about what she had said. As the Lords enter the room in all their finery Elayne observes that Rand is like a stork among peacocks in his plain clothes but that he has a presence about him that says that he is in command and that the Tairens recognize it."

He takes on a Fade right outside his door and shouts out battle cries in the hope of keeping the remaining Defenders of the Stone from fleeing and they begin to echo his shouts. Rand battles with the Fade and each time his Power-wrought sword meets the Fade's Thakan'dar blade lightning flashes from them. Eventually he begins to overpower the Fade and his blade shears the Fades in two. He kills the Fade also taking out the Trollocs that are bonded with it. The Defenders obey his commands about the injured and the care of their blades. This is the first time they have accepted his leadership, so he orders them to follow him, again shouting battle cries (which they also take up).\nHe leads the remaining Defenders through the Stone killing as many Shadowspawn as possible. Everywhere there is fighting in small groups. Some of the Aiel join him along the way. At one point he sees Moiraine and Lan and sees Lan get injured but can do nothing to help as he is swamped by Trollocs. By the time he is finished with them Moiraine and Lan are gone. He also notices that some of the battles going on are between men and those Darkfriends in the Stone that have sided with the Shadowspawn. He also sees Trollocs fighting Trollocs and assumes that the Myrddraal have lost control over them and their bloodlust has taken over.\nRand takes on a group of Trollocs, one of which falls trapping him as another advances on him. A fourth Trolloc splits the advancing Trolloc's head open and leaves Rand alone. Rand is astonished that a Trolloc appears to have saved him. Rand stops to watch two Fades fighting each other in the hallways. Lanfear appears behind him and pretty much admits that this conflict between the Shadowspawn is her doing. He uses the Power to pin her up against the wall but cannot remember how to shield her. She reminds Rand that he has left Callandor in his rooms and that anyone could take it. She then breaks his weaves and taunts him. He leaves her to run back to his rooms for Callandor. He is hesitant to use it but takes it up anyway. A Fade appears in the doorway and he reaches for saidin using Callandor. The Fade turns to flee but, without even realizing he had channeled he destroys it.\nHe then goes after the remaining Shadowspawn burning them all with the Power where they stand. Rand needs to do more, something to kill all of them. He raises Callandor and draws on the Source, he has no idea what he does but creates a spinning mass of light and it seems like a voice in his head is telling when to unleash it. Lightning from the mass goes shooting across the ceilings which strike down at all the Shadowspawn throughout the Stone. He can feel the lightning striking them down.\nMoiraine appears and also does not know what he did. She is shocked and lost for words, but seems to think there may be something wrong with Rand and keeps her distance. Rand sees a small girl dead and is so distressed he tries to bring her back to life using Callandor and the Power but it does not work and he begs for Moiraine to Heal her. She tells him she cannot Heal the dead but that she will see that the girl's body is taken care of. Rand is upset that he is too late to save them all. He then asks if his friends are alive and Moiraine tells him that they are. Lan explains that the Trollocs came in on grain barges and wagons and he is contemptuous that nobody thought to check why grain should be brought to the Stone. Rand tells Moiraine about Lanfear but she is not surprised, she tells Rand about Lanfear and Lews Therin's relationship. Moiraine Heals Rand and he finally tells her that he will decide his next move that night and tell her tomorrow."

She is run over by the charging boar this time and when she scrambles to her feet, she finds the same Aiel woman from before looking at her.\nThe Aiel woman's spear is pointed at her and Egwene tries to make her lower it long enough so she can concentrate and get back to the palace, so she dresses herself in cadin'sor. As a result the Aiel woman tells her she has no right to wear cadin'sor and dreams her clothes away and Egwene is left naked. She concentrates to get her clothes back and fix the Aiel woman naked in her mind long enough for her to get back to Tanchico. She briefly glimpses a blonde woman with a silver bow before getting back.\nOnce back in Tanchico it is not long before the Aiel woman finds her again and introduces herself as Amys.\nIt is obvious that Amys knows much more about the World of Dreams and just before Egwene is pulled out she demands that Egwene come to her in Cold Rocks Hold."

Egwene asks Aviendha if she knows Amys and Cold Rocks Hold. From Aviendha they learn that Amys was Far Dareis Mai before she became a Dreamwalker and Wise One. Aviendha briefly explains about Aiel relationships and that Amys is sister-wife to Lian, who is Aviendha's sister-mother.\nThe girls are shocked when they hear about the Aiel customs for women marrying the same man. Egwene tells them what Amys said about there being evil in Tanchico. They decide it would be best for Egwene to go to Amys and learn as much as she can about Tel'aran'rhiod even though it means leaving Elayne and Nynaeve behind to look for the Black Ajah.\nAt this point Moiraine enters the room to inform them about Joiya's and Amico's killing during the attack on the Stone. She describes the gruesome way they were killed and it makes the women sick to their stomachs. They wonder why they were killed and by whom. Moiraine says the guards never saw anyone come down to the dungeons, so it seems the Shadow has more resources than they know.\nWhen they tell her of Egwene's plans to go to the Waste, Aviendha remarks she would rather stay with Elayne and Nynaeve to go to Tanchico.\nThe women are very surprised at Aviendha's refusal to go with Egwene and Aviendha is indeed behaving very strangely. She almost seems to be sulking.\nAt this point Moiraine produces a letter from the Wise Ones stating that Aviendha is to come to them at Rhuidean. Aviendha's behaviour becomes even stranger as she proclaims she is Far Dareis Mai and does not go running at everyone's beck and call. Aviendha balks and storms out the room, while the others are left behind in wonder. Egwene wonders why the Wise Ones want Aviendha. They finally settle down to prepare for their trips to the Waste and Tanchico. Moiraine tells them there is a Atha'an Miere ship at the docks that they can take to Tanchico."

He is going over the attack on the Stone by the Shadowspawn in his head. How a Gray Man had hunted him down, only to be replaced by a Myrddraal after he killed it. Just when he thought he was almost certainly doomed a group of Trollocs of all things came to his rescue. While his mind is recollecting what happened that night he finds that his finger has drawn an open door on the table.\nWhile he is sitting there drinking his wine he catches a bit of conversation and makes his way over to the table it came from. They are talking about the Two Rivers and the merchant takes Mat for a noble. The merchant says he thinks there will be no tobacco coming out of the Two Rivers that year. When Mat presses him for the reason he learns that the Whitecloaks have moved into the Two Rivers in search of the \"false\" Dragon and a man with golden eyes. Mat demands to know if there are other rumours that they are hunting someone else, but the merchant says he hasn't heard anything of the sort. Mat makes his way back onto the muddy streets while he tries to process what he's just heard. He rushes back to the Stone to tell Perrin this terrible news only to find him already packing his bags.\nPerrin has already heard the news and is wondering how to tell Faile he is leaving for the Two Rivers. He asks Mat if he wants to come. As much as he wants to, he cannot even bring himself to say he will go. Rand's pull on him is too strong. In the end he makes Perrin promise to take care of his family while he is there.\nWhen he walks out of Perrin's room he has a little run-in with the First of Mayene.

Nightmares of \"trying to fight Whitecloaks, because the Whitecloaks were killing Faile\". After washing and dressing, Perrin goes to find Loial, noticing that \"little evidence remained of the night's attack\" because \"the Majhere had her liveried servants out in force\". However, Perrin could still smell the blood that had been shed throughout the night and yearns to leave the Stone. When he reaches Loial's room, he sees that it was in fact made for an Ogier, even though \"the Stone of Tear predated even the age of the great Ogier stoneworks\".\nIt turns out that Loial has spent most of the time after the attack writing notes about it for his book. His room is filled with flowers but Perrin notices the \"swollen knot on Loial's head\" and volunteers to fetch Moiraine so that she can Heal him. Loial explains that he considers it nothing worth bothering her for, especially since \"there were so many who truly needed her help\". Perrin is startled when Faile stands up and informs him that Loial was a hero. \"He gathered as many children as he could... into a large room, and held the door alone against Trollocs and Myrddraal\". Whilst telling him that, Faile manages to chastise Perrin, even though she does not say anything out loud.\nPerrin asks Loial if he has \"heard from your mother\", which he hasn't, though \"I saw Laefar in the city yesterday\". Apparently, Loial's mother has chosen his wife already and means to have him settled in a stedding as soon as she finds him. Perrin uses this to his advantage and asks Loial to accompany him to the Two Rivers, \"Your mother won't find you there\". Though Loial is reluctant to leave Rand, which would mean disrupting his book, Perrin explains that he needs Loial because the Whitecloaks are hurting the people in the Two Rivers. Loial agrees to travel with Perrin and guide him through the Ways but then Faile explains that it won't be possible for him to do that.\nFaile has tricked Loial into helping her go with Perrin; she has made him swear \"to take me into the Ways whenever I asked, and before anyone else\". This means that she will travel to the Two Rivers and if Perrin wants to go there, he must ask to accompany her. Perrin refuses to ask her and Faile refuses to relent, despite Loial's pleas for them to agree to go together. Faile insists that they leave as soon as she and Loial are ready and when Perrin leaves, neither of them have relented, \"Stubborn, muleheaded woman\". As Perrin walks back to his room, he meets Gaul who volunteers to accompany Perrin to the Two Rivers. Gaul was told by Rand about the situation and has agreed to go with Perrin, much to Perrin's delight."

Elayne regrets the letter she wrote to him, a letter full of love, \"laying my heart open like a stone-blind fool\". Elayne is relieved that he did not try to stop her but is angry that he was so emotionless. Their conversation is interrupted when Lan enters the room; he is trying to keep a reign on his temper and emotions but is obviously failing, \"he was at a breaking point now\".\nLan is angry that Nynaeve did not tell him that she wasn't leaving for Tar Valon, \"You let me believe you were returning to Tar Valon\"; in fact, she is leaving for Tanchico. Lan doesn't want her to go to Tanchico, \"Tanchico is now no place for anyone\", and disapproves of her leaving Tar Valon and that Moiraine included her in the questioning of the Black Ajah. Nynaeve informs him that she is going to Tanchico and Lan suggests that \"I could... I could protect you\". Nynaeve refuses to accept this offer, \"your place is with Moiraine\". After Lan objects to this, Nynaeve orders him to stay with Moiraine and shows him the letter from the Amyrlin Seat, \"Whatever the bearer does is done at my order and by my authority\". When Lan asks why Nynaeve has the letter, she refuses to answer, \"Ask no questions I cannot answer\".\nWhen Nynaeve insists that \"we do as we must, as you will\", Lan loses his remaining patience and kisses her hard. Though she protests at first, \"her kicks slowed and stopped\"; however, when the kiss ends, she berates him for kissing her \"for the whole world to see\". Lan replies that if she dies on the journey to Tanchico, \"I will not survive you long\" and leaves the room. When Egwene asks Nynaeve why she let him go back to Moiraine, she answers that \"I will not have him remembering a broken oath to Moiraine\". Nynaeve is not sure how she will get Lan away from Moiraine but \"what must be done, can be done\". The three Accepted say their goodbyes to each other and warn each other to be careful, \"Tanchico is not much safer than the Waste now\". Elayne thinks to herself that she will write another letter to Rand, a fiercer letter, \"Men needed a firm hand\"."

He stops to talk to a group of servants in the pretence of \"trying to raise spirits\"; in fact, he is using his skill at Daes Dae'mar to try to help Rand. He talks to the servants about how the boats of Trollocs went unnoticed, \"it is a shame that no one asked why those barges were at the docks\". He mentions that the High Lords should have asked about it and sews doubt into the minds of the servants. If they can't trust the High Lords, they will turn to \"the man they knew the nobles hated... Rand al'Thor\". It appears that Thom has been using Daes Dae'mar a lot to help Rand gain support in Tear, \"he had scattered other seeds that night\". He leaves the servants when the Majhere shows up and threatens to make Thom start cleaning, \"idle hands are idle hands\".\nWhen he gets back to his room, he finds Moiraine there, looking \"as if she had a perfect right to be going through the papers\" in his bedroom. He thinks that she is a beautiful woman but berates himself for thinking that way about an Aes Sedai. He hopes that she hasn't looked in the chest underneath the desk and that he hasn't left anything incriminating in the room. Moiraine Heals the stiffness in Thom's leg, wishing that an Aes Sedai had been near when it happened so that Thom could have been Healed. Moiraine talks about the events yesterday where the High Lord Carleon died in a hunting accident, killed by his friend Tedosian. \"Tedosian fell ill not an hour after returning to the Stone\" and his wife vows to nurse him all the time until he is better, for which Tedosian is not happy about it. Both High Lords \"led the faction that wants to kill Rand\". The implication is that Thom has used Daes Dae'mar to kill the two men, although one has survived, and that Moiraine knows what he has done.\nMoiraine goes on to talk about the time Thom spent at the Andoran Royal Court. She implies that Thom might have had something to do with the death of Taringail, \"fortunate for Morgase, Taringail's death\"; Thom's reaction suggests that the implication might be true. Thom talks about Moiraine to cover his surprise. Moiraine is of the Cairhienin House Damodred and was closely related to royalty. She was Taringail's half-sister and \"King Laman's niece\". He points out that aiding Rand means that she has high connections in the Tower, \"someone in the Hall of the White Tower\"; it is Siuan Sanche who gives Moiraine the protection she needs to stay close to Rand. Moiraine replies that not using her House in her title is by choice because \"House Damodred had a deservedly unpleasant reputation\" and still does.\nMoiraine wants him to go with Elayne and Nynaeve to Tanchico to protect them, \"your knowledge and skills might keep them alive\". Thom thinks that she wants him out of the way as it will \"leave the boy naked to her manipulations\". Moiraine insists that going to Tanchico will not kill him \"and by the First Oath, you know it for true\". Thom is not convinced and so Moiraine uses Elayne and his nephew Owyn as levers to get what she wants. In return for Thom going to Tanchico, she will give him the names of the Red sisters who gentled Owyn after Tanchico. Mentioning Owyn strikes a nerve with Thom and after Moiraine leaves, Thom decides to go to Tanchico."

Laras, the Mistress of the Kitchens, has \"a place in her heart for pretty, flirtatious girls\" and so has taken 'Elmindreda' under her wing. Laras keeps a watchful eye on Min and has started to teach her \"every trick of 'lively' women\". Min sits on a bench and starts to unpick her sewing, \"a woman could sit for hours with an embroidery hoop, watching everyone and everything\". Min watches the people in the White Tower for useful auras to report to the Amyrlin Seat. Her sewing is interrupted by Gawyn and Galad; Gawyn knows who she is, though Galad doesn't, and \"he did take any opportunity to tease\".\nA slight slip causes Galad to ask \"Can it be we have met before\" but some quick words and the entire image of Elmindreda diffuses these thoughts. Min has dressed differently to her old tom-boyish clothes and uses makeup to complete the image. Gawyn asks her to read part of a book, 'The Way of the Light', and to tell Galad that it is nonsense. Min pretends not to understand what is written, \"I fear I know little of books\", but Gawyn tells her that it was written by the founder of the Whitecloaks, Lothair Mantelar. Galad insists that \"He was a great man\", though the Whitecloaks \"have sometimes been... excessive\". Gawyn then asks her if the Amyrlin Seat has told her anything about Elayne or Egwene and Min has to talk quickly to distract attention away from herself, \"I suppose she hopes I'll make a decision soon\", and uses her excuse for being in the Tower.\nAs she looks around, Min sees Logain, a man who was gentled after claiming to be the Dragon Reborn. She sees an aura around him, \"a flaring halo...radiant in gold and blue\"; it is a promise of glory to come. Min decides to go to tell the Amyrlin Seat, using fear of Logain as an excuse, \"he's made me feel faint\", but Gawyn follows her. Min scolds him for bringing up the subject of Elayne and Egwene, \"Elmindreda never met them\", but Gawyn is still worried, especially since he thinks that's there is a false Dragon in Tear. He goes on to tell her that not knowing about the three Accepted has made Galad associate with Whitecloaks and Gawyn is worried about him too. She leaves Gawyn and proceeds to go to the Amyrlin's Study.\nNot seeing Leane in the antechamber, Min walks into the study, only to be confronted by an angry Siuan Sanche and Leane. She tells them of Logain's aura and Siuan goes on to tell her of other bad news; \"starvation in Cairhien\", an Aes Sedai missing in Tanchico, no doubt due to the Black Ajah, the Prophet causing trouble and war in Arad Doman. There is one piece of good news, \"the Blight has retreated for some reason\". Min tells the Amyrlin that she wants to go to Tear to be with Rand but Siuan wants her to stay because her aura readings are useful. Min has caught a groom stealing and pointed out a novice who was having an affair with a guard, \"Sheriam cut that short\". Min argues with Siuan about Gawyn's concern for Elayne and Egwene and then why they haven't heard word from Tear.\nThe argument stops when a novice arrives to give two letters. One says that \"Mazrim Taim has escaped\" and a sister is dead because of it. The Amyrlin orders a dozen Aes Sedai and a thousand guards to be sent after him, \"I'll not risk another Guaire Amalasan\". Taim is to be gentled as soon as he is found, despite the Tower Law. The other is from Moiraine, \"The sling has been used. The shepherd holds the sword\", telling them that Rand has Callandor. It is interesting to note that they have only read one of the several letters Moiraine wrote, so others must have been discovered, though by whom we do not know. Siuan orders that the Hall of the Tower meet as soon as possible so that she can tell them that the Dragon Reborn holds Tear. Siuan can now act openly in guiding Rand."

None of the Aiel would ride a horse, \"I offered to buy them horses, and they looked offended\", and so they had to run to catch up the group. While they wait, Faile wastes no time in trying to unsettle Perrin, \"He is very boastful about his eyesight... but his memory is not very good\". The Aiel join them very quickly, much to Faile's surprise. We learn from Bain and Chiad's taunting that Stone Dogs \"take their vows not to retreat\" and from Gaul that Maidens are commonly used as scouts.\nFaile insists that they set off to find the Waygate quickly and so they split into two groups, Perrin's and Faile's. While Perrin enjoys watching the herds of horses they pass as they\u200b ride, Loial is aghast that what was once an Ogier grove has been destroyed and what's left is only grass. He is especially upset that the Great Trees have gone, \"It is the trees we love\". Loial is extremely angry and Perrin understands why Ogier have been called \"implacable enemies\". Though Ogier are slow to anger, they are deadly when they are.\nWhen they reach the Waygate, Loial moves the Avendesora leaf and opens it. As it opens, the leaves \"took a tinge of green, of life\" and in the Waygate they can see their own reflections, dull and murky. Loial tells them that \"Once... the Waygates shone like mirrors, and those who walked through the Ways walked through the sun and the sky\". Perrin is the first to go in, determined to get there before Faile. Gaul follows him and together they follow the white line to the guidepost. There they are out of view and Perrin wants Faile to be anxious that he is lost, if only for a minute or two."

              "pov_summary": "Elayne and Nynaeve arrive at the docks after a rough ride in the carriage, \"How did you manage to find every last rut and hole between here and the Stone?\" The carriage has no sigil or house colours as no Tairen lord wants to be associated with Aes Sedai. The people they see at the docks have obviously been treated badly by the High Lords of Tear and Elayne has \"the urge to teach these folks dignity\". The Sea Folk raker is the largest ship there \"with three great towering masts amidships\" and from the tales of the Atha'an Miere, it offers the mystery of far lands and different people.\nNynaeve blames the driver for the bad journey and so Elayne pays him and gives him some praise before they leave; \"a kind word and a little praise were usually received as well as silver was, if not better\". After the servant has gone, Nynaeve chastises Elayne for giving him too much money, \"We do not have the Realm of Andor's resources for our own use\". As they walk to the raker, Elayne advises Nynaeve to be tactful so that she doesn't offend the crew. They spot two women on the ship \"who were obviously not ordinary crew\". Both women have pierced ears and a chain runs from their nose to their ear, with medallions hanging off the chain.\nThey approach the two women and, remembering what Moiraine has told them, introduce themselves formally. They introduce themselves as being Aes Sedai of the Green Ajah, \"Moiraine had seemed resigned to that more than anything else\". The older of the two women introduces herself as Coine, Sailmistress of Wavedancer, and the other woman as her sister, Jorin, Windfinder of Wavedancer. It is a surprise to Elayne that they are sisters because though she \"could see the resemblance (...) Jorin looked much younger\". Nynaeve asks to talk of their sailing and the gift of passage; \"The Sea Fold did not charge for passage (...) it was a gift, which just coincidentally would be exchanged for a gift of equal value\". Coine leads them below deck so that they can talk.\nAs they enter the cabin, Elayne notices a helmet and without thinking gasps out, \"Seanchan\", as it is the helmet of a Seanchan soldier. Coine tells them that they met a Seanchan ship and the soldiers tried to board Wavedancer; \"I have the helmet to remind me\". Nynaeve warns them about the damane the Seanchan keep on their ships. A female member of the crew brings them tea and to their surprise, \"she was bare to the waist, just like the men above\". Coine orders the girl, Dorele, to work in the bilges \"where clothes are a hindrance\". She apologizes to Elayne and Nynaeve who quickly assure her that they aren't offended, \"there are different ways among different people\".\nTalk turns to sailing and Nynaeve offers Coine three thousand gold marks to take them to Tanchico. Coine points out that it is a large amount of money \"even counting that you ask me to alter my sailing plans\". She adds that Aes Sedai are usually refused the gift of passage and that \"Aes Sedai know this, and so almost never ask\". Nynaeve demands to know why they were brought down below if they are to be refused. Coine explains that she has heard that Rand holds Callandor and the Aiel support him, \"Prophecy is being fulfilled\". She talks of the Jendai Prophecy and the Coramoor, obviously Rand. She explains that the Sea Folk welcome the prophecy, \"The one we seek, herald of a new Age\", and that they will serve the Coramoor. It is said that \"The White Tower will be broken by his name, and Aes Sedai shall kneel to wash his feet\".\nShe asks them why they want to go to Tanchico, \"It is an unpleasant port of call now\". Much to Nynaeve's reluctance, Elayne explains about the Black Ajah; \"We must find them, else they may harm (...) the Coramoor\". Surprisingly, it is Jorin, the Windfinder, who insists that they are given passage; \"We can take them, my sister. We must\". Before they can discuss anything else, a man, Coine's husband, comes into the cabin, talking of trade. Much to his surprise, Coine informs him that they will be leaving before he can receive any of his trade. He reveals himself to be Cargomaster upon the Wavedancer but he is overruled by Coine about when they are to leave. He is angered further when he discovers that they won't be sailing to Shara; \"What I have in my holds will bring little in Tanchico\". Coine doesn't give him an explanation as to why the plans have changed and he leaves them.\nNynaeve asks why Coine didn't explain that they were going to Tanchico for the three thousand gold crowns. Coine explains that \"many among the crew consider Aes Sedai bad luck\" and that if they knew of the Black Ajah, their passage would be troubled. Both Elayne and Nynaeve agree to hide their rings and the fact that they are Aes Sedai for the voyage. Coine then tells them that she will not accept the money and that \"I will put in the gift of passage from my own chest\", despite Jorin's argument that it will anger Toram further. Before they can talk further, the ship suddenly rolls as if they are in fierce water, not the Tairen docks. Jorin and Coine leave to check on the ship."

              "pov_summary": "Elayne and Nynaeve go up onto the deck to see if the ship is all right, which it is. Elayne believes that her letter caused Rand to overreact and channel, \"Men always overreact when they let their emotions go\". They then notice that Thom and Juilin are trying to board the ship and Coine tells them that they want passage. Under normal circumstances, she couldn't refuse them but \"I will do so, if you ask it\". Coine knows Juilin as \"twice he has found those who pilfered from us\". Nynaeve and Elayne decide to talk to the two men before making up their minds on whether or not to ask Coine to refuse passage.\nAs they approach the two men, Elayne thinks that she recognises Thom, \"She had been struck by something familiar about him\", though she cannot remember why. She then asks Juilin why he wants to travel to Tanchico and reminds him that \"You had not served us very well\". He points out that the last time he saw them he helped them escape from their cell in the Stone; Nynaeve is not happy about being reminded \"that they had needed help that time\". He then tells them that he was woken by Lan who asked him to accompany them to Tanchico. Apparently, Rand also gave a message for Juilin telling him to do that and \"I was given a great quantity of gold\". Both men were emphatic that if they did not return in one piece, \"Shall we just say it would be better to drown myself than come back\".\nThom then explains that \"a lady of our mutual acquaintance\", Moiraine, asked him to accompany them. He has been to Tanchico before and can \"help you with a good many things\". Elayne is once again struck with the familiarity of Thom and pulls one of his moustaches, \"I seemed to remember doing that before\". Nynaeve then agrees that they should be allowed passage and makes the two men swear that they will do as they are told. Both agree reluctantly and go to see Coine. Nynaeve explains that they must be firm with Thom and Juilin because at least Thom knows that they are Accepted, not full Aes Sedai, and they will soon know that they will search for the Black Ajah. She doesn't trust either man because \"Juilin Sandar betrayed us once before\" and for Thom, \"He admits being sent by Moiraine\".\nA Tairen pilot is ushered aboard and they set sail out through the Fingers of the Dragon. As they see the Sea of Storms, the pilot leaves the ship and they sail out into the sea. When they can no longer see land, all the women take their blouses off, as is customary for the Sea Folk. Elayne talks to Thom when she sees that he is alone up on deck; \"Are you not happy, Master Merrilin?\" Thom's answer explains that he feels trapped, probably talking about how Moiraine convinced him into going to Tanchico, though Elayne doesn't know this. He talks of how the events leading up to Tarmon Gai'don will not be known in the next age, that the characters will all be changed; \"two dozen generations and you may be the hero of it\". He then talks about legends from the age before the Age of Legends, which seem familiar to our age. \"Mosk and Merk\" describe Russia and America in the Cold War while Elsbet is Queen Elizabeth I of England. This makes most people believe that we are living in the age before the Age of Legends.\nThom goes on to talk about Shara, the land beyond the Aiel Waste. He explains that the Sea Folk only see \"a few miles around the handful or harbours where they are permitted to land\". Landing anywhere apart from these harbours is forbidden and it was the same for the Cairhienin traders who travelled the Silk Path. Elayne points out that he could learn more from the Sea Folk about Shara, something that puzzles Thom; \"I have never heard any such name\". When Elayne asks him why he agreed to accompany them, he explains that \"Aes Sedai asking favours are not easily resisted\". Elayne then leaves Thom and walks towards the stern of the ship.\nThere, she sees Jorin channeling weaves of Air and Water, changing the weather so it is favourable for the ship. When Elayne approaches her, Jorin explains \"I meant not to do this at all, but Coine says we must go quickly\". Elayne realises that that was why \"the Sea Folk do not carry Aes Sedai\" and \"That is why it was your decision to let us aboard\". Jorin explains that it is kept secret because \"Your White Tower will try to interfere\" and Elayne cannot deny that. Not all the Windfinders can channel and some channelers are sent to the White Tower to avoid suspicion. Elayne promises to try to keep the matter secret.\nShe then asks if there was a damane on the Seanchan ship they had encountered. Jorin says that there was and that \"I regret it because we might have saved the woman, the damane\". Elayne asks Jorin to teach her how to change the weather because of the complexity and size of the weaves, \"I am astounded, Jorin\". She also learns that they will reach Tanchico in ten days, something she had thought impossible."

The Tairen nobility has never been called to the Stone this way. The packed crowd gives way as Moiraine and Egwene make their way through and Moiraine stares down a Noblewoman. Moiraine wonders where Lan went to, as she can not see him in the crowd, even though she senses he is near. They have no clue about what Rand is planning on telling these nobles who stand around in nervous crowds. Moiraine suggests that Egwene wins Rand's confidence and she is not too happy about Egwene's persistence about going to the Waste but she thinks to herself it might be better in the end. At least Elayne and Nynaeve are safely on their way to Tanchico on the Windfinders ship. Moiraine ponders if her suspicions about the Windfinders will prove to be correct.\nThom Merrilin also seems to have disappeared from the Tower but Moiraine suspects he went with the two girls. Moiraine also received the most amazing letter from the Aiel Wise Ones. Moiraine regrets him leaving as he was very useful in keeping the nobles and their intrigues out of Rand's way. She notices the High lady Alteima and Estanda giving each other looks that go beyond mere rivalry.\nMat is standing across from them, his clothes looking like he slept in them and his boots all scuffed. They wonder where Perrin is, as he does not seem to be among the crowd gathered.\nTo Egwene's surprise Moiraine mentions Faile has been trying to talk him into leaving. Rand appears at this moment with a hundred veiled Aiel in his wake. Rand tells the gathering about the treaty with Mayene and orders the Tairen army to march to Cairhien, not to go to war with them but to try and help them restore law and order. Then, in a historical moment he drives his sword Callandor into the Heart of the Stone, challenging anyone to take the sword if they dare while he is gone. Rand storms out, followed closely by Moiraine and Egwene demanding an explanation for why he would give up on a great power like Callandor. Rand says he was merely fulfilling the prophecies and tells them about the trap he has set with the One Power should anyone try to take it.\nAfter that he tells them he means to go to Rhuidean."

Rand refused to announce his trek out of the city, but word spread like wildfire anyway as they leave the Stone. People flock to see the large number of Aiel. Rand and Egwene briefly discuss if Rand should have let them take the \"fifth\". Rand mentions that he saw Aviendha showing Rhuarc a silver bowl, and Egwene turns around to say that it IS their custom after all. It is a strange procession with the Aiel, Lan and Moiraine and Rand on his new horse Jeade'en, \"True Finder\" in the old tongue. Egwene starts talking to Rand about Elayne but Moiraine cuts in, demanding to know Rand's plan. He tells them he means to take them to Rhuidean by means of a Portal Stone only one hour's ride away from Tear. The plan is not met with approval, everybody thinks he is mad to try and use the Portal Stone and will probably kill them all in the process. Rand offers Mat the chance to leave right there and then, but Mat refuses saying he wants to see Rhuidean. They ride on till they reach the spot where the Portal Stone should be located although all Rand has to go on are some old maps he found in the library of the Stone. He tells them about the manuscript he found from a peddler who ventured into the Waste and claimed to see a golden city floating above the clouds, but more to the point how he describes a Portal Stone near Rhuidean in details. So this is how Rand is sure there is a Portal Stone out there as well. The old maps are different from the landscape now and Rand is not sure exactly where to find the stone. Lan suggests he sends out the Aiel to find the stone. Rhuarc picks members\u200b from every clan until a good quarter of them are fanning out over the surrounding hills to find the Stone. Rand watches them go and muses about the Jenn Aiel, about Aiel and their blood feuds, and wonders out loud what it is that holds them together now, here.\nRhuarc says they follow the prophecy and seek He Who Comes With The Dawn and how none may shed blood on the grounds of Rhuidean.\nAviendha finds the Stone and Rand tries to decide which is the right symbol that will take them to the Stone in Rhuidean out of all the symbols on the Stone. With the help of Rhuarc he finds the symbol for Rhuidean and under the heavy protests of his friends he prepares to channel through it.\nRand gets everyone close around him and gets ready to channel through the Portal Stone with help of an angreal he found in the Great Hold, a little fat man holding a sword across his knees. When everyone is ready, he draws on the Power through the angreal and suddenly the world blinks out of existence.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

The men all visibly relax, it seems they were not so sure the peace would hold. Aviendha promptly starts to move to the camps, but is stopped by the Wise Ones, saying she has run long enough. Rhuarc goes to greet his wife Amys and tells her she probably didn't expect him to turn up like that, to which she replies she knew he would be there that day. Egwene finally understands Moiraine's remarks about how useful Dreaming would be and why Moiraine did not try and talk Rand out of using the Portal Stone. Heirn is there to meet Rhuarc, saying that he has come to protect the Wise Ones.\nLan whispers to Moirane and Egwene that the Wise Ones can go anywhere without being in danger from attack, so Heirn really came to protect Rhuarc, only it would not be honorable to say so. Moiraine raises an eyebrow at Lan's knowledge of the Aiel and he remarks she never asked him about it, something she plans on correcting very soon.\nThe Shaido are there and have sent Muradin to Rhuidean to become their new clan chief. Couladin remarks he will enter should Muradin fail, but the Wise One's flat out refuse him, saying he is flawed inside. Rand formally requests to be admitted to Rhuidean and although the Wise Ones are mildly surprised they agree. To everyone's surprise Mat also asks to be permitted to enter Rhuidean.

Mat tells Rand he has to enter, even though the thought is not very tempting. He challenges Rand on why he thinks he has to go into Rhuidean, as if being the Dragon Reborn is not enough, but he also has to be an Aiel clan chief.\nAbruptly Rand steps into the mist and with a moment of hesitation Mat follows him. The fog seems to go on forever but they finally step out into a hollow dome. Rhuidean is not as big as Tear or Caemlyn, but the streets are very wide, if deserted, with great fountains and statues. The city appears unfinished for all its splendor. No water fills any of the fountains. The fountains make Rand think though and suddenly realises when looking at the city that it must have had access to water at some point.\nRand channels water up through the ground from an underground lake that he can detect with the Power. Rand mentions the Wise Ones told him to go to \"the heart\" and he assumes this means the center of the city. They drink their fill and move on to the centre of the city. After they walked for about a mile, the street suddenly ended at a great plaza. In the middle of the plaza they see a huge tree and they would have wondered how it could have survived without sunshine all this time, if it was not for all the items scattered across the plaza attracting their attention.

Rand stops briefly at two statues of a man and a woman holding a crystal sphere, but quickly walks on towards the columns and the Avendesora tree in the middle of the plaza.\nRand enters the columns after they agree Mat will stay behind. Mat walks around and finds another strangely twisted doorframe. Thinking he will be able to get more answers, he steps through. In the doorway he does not find the snake people like before, but is met by a fox-like creature that leads him through a long narrow hallway. He enters a room that was not there before and finds himself facing eight more of these fox-people. He demands answers to his questions and when they do not respond he gets angry, making a comment about the holes in his memory. They reply it \"is done\". He insists on being free from Aes Sedai and the Power. They reply it \"is done\". Mat wants to get away if he would receive no answers to his questions. The answer is the same.

The man asks Rhodric if the Aiel and the Jenn are truly the same and he says they are the same and they are not, and that he can't explain further. Garam tells him his father has an Aes Sedai advisor and that they mean to build their own city. He thinks they should attack, and destroy the Aes Sedai before they break the world again."

Jeordam says that is a lie and he has never held a sword. He points them in the direction of their wagons in case they are lost. They reply they are not lost. Jeordam didn't think they were, as the Jenn only came to them if they were desperate. He takes them to his father's tent. Their camp is the largest of the ten Aiel groups, with almost two hundred people. The Jenn woman tells them that they were betrayed while trading, they came back in the night to take back what they had traded and killed several of their people, taking others captive. Lewin, tells the Jenn that they will bring back their captured people and if they want to stay they are welcome to do so, but they will have to pick up the spear and never be allowed back to the Jenn. One of them heads back at that, but Morin, the Jenn woman picks up a spear as well and tells Jeordam that it is her husband now, and so the first Maiden of the Spear is born."

Some of the wagons are burning, many of the people are lying dead on the ground and the horses have been driven off. Adan takes no real notice of the crated objects that he was transporting for the Aes Sedai, which have been carelessly toppled into the dirt. He is occupied by the men with weapons, who had done the killing, who are loading women into the empty wagons. His daughter Rhea and only remaining living child is among them, his son Marind had been killed that morning. He wants to stop them but is afraid to in case the children are injured or killed. So he makes himself watch, whilst comforting the two children, as the wagons and people are taken away and out of sight. Adan tells the children to stay where they are and goes down to look at one of the bodies. It is his wife Siedre. He is approached by the remaining men and is addressed by the leader Sulwin who asks what he plans to do. Adan responds that he plans to go on, that there is nothing else that can be done. Sulwin argues that it is impossible but Adan insists that it can be done and that they must be faithful to their duty. Sulwin disagrees and says that they need to find a place of safety and that some of them mean to do that - to find a place where they can sing again. Adan scoffs at this and says that the songs are gone and the old days are gone and that they should not give up their promise to the Aes Sedai to go after something lost. Sulwin argues and his followers begin unloading some of the wagons. One of the crates falls over and crashes open revealing what looks like a polished doorframe of dark red stone. Adan is angry and shouts at Sulwin and the others that they are not Aiel and that they are lost. Sulwin replies that at least they keep the Way of the Leaf. Adan turns his attention back to the wagons, to the many dead and injured, to the stone doorframe, tumbled piles of figurines, odd shapes in crystal standing among the potted Chora cuttings. Turns his attention to saving at least some of the things entrusted to them by the Aes Sedai. He sees Maigran and Lewin clutching at their Mother's skirts and is glad that Saralin is alive to take care of them. Then he lifts up his wife's body and weeps."

He thinks to himself that perhaps if Alnora was still alive he would have found all this easier but without her dreams he doesn't know what to do or where to go. In fact, he hardly cares to live. They had fewer wagons and people now. Adan meets him at the first wagon - he reminds Jonai of Willim. But Willim had been sent away years ago when he had started to channel. Adan tells him that Ogier have arrived from the north. They were a bedraggled band no more than fifty in number and this shocked him as he was used to seeing it in his own people but had not expected to see it in the Ogier. He remembers the last time he had seen an Aes Sedai had been just after Alnora had died. She had healed the sick, taken some of the sa'angreal and gone laughing bitterly when he had asked whether there was a place of safety. Her dress had been worn and patched and he thought that she must have been going mad as she had claimed that Ishamael, one of the Forsaken, was only partially trapped and still touched the world. Jonai pulls himself back to the present. The Ogier notice that there are Chora tree cuttings on the wagons. They also discuss that the Blight is growing southward and the Myrddraal and Trollocs are roaming there. Jonai realizes that they therefore cannot travel north. The Ogier asks Jonai if he knows where any of the stedding are. He is stunned that they cannot find them themselves because the land has changed so much. The Ogier think that if they don't find a stedding soon they will die, that they can feel a longing in their bones. Jonai feels a tightness in his chest at the Ogier's words. The land had changed so much, the Blight was growing, there were still Myrddraal and Trollocs alive, people stealing, people who didn't recognise the Da'shain, the Ogier and Aiel both lost. He can barely breathe\u200b and sinks down to his knees clutching at his chest. His son Adan kneels beside him and asks if he is all right. Jonai tells him to take the people south to keep the Covenant and guard what the Aes Sedai gave them, to keep the Way of the Leaf, while the pain is tearing his chest."

He was wearing his work clothes, his cadin'sor, though the work he had been given was nothing he had been trained for. He was 63, in the prime of his life but he felt old and tired. He enters the Hall of Servants and no one questioned him as there was no one left to do so. Lots of people inside were dashing about in panic which grew every time the ground shook. He slips in through the door of a room where about six Aes Sedai, all women, were stood around a long table arguing. Jonai shivered and wondered if men would ever stand in a meeting like that again. There was a crystal sword on the table, perhaps an object of the Power perhaps not, holding down the Dragon banner of Lews Therin. He cannot understand why the banner has not been destroyed. Oselle is shouting at Deindre because the latter had a Foretelling but could not tell them when it would happen. Deindre remains calm and Solinda interjects into the argument. Jonai then notices that he is not the only one in the room with the Aes Sedai. Someshta, one of the Nym sits against the wall. The Nym seems troubled. Someshta does not recognise him, but he remembers that there was singing and recognises Jonai as a \"Child of the Dragon\". Jonai winces at the title because it is dangerous now that so few people seem to remember that the Da'Shain served all Aes Sedai, not just the Dragon. Solinda Sedai asks Jonai if everything is ready and he replies that it is but that some of them wish to remain and serve. She sighs and talks to him of what happened to the Aiel at Tzora, when thousands\u200b of them linked arms, singing, trying to remind Jaric Mondoran who he was and stop his madness and he killed them all. She says that there is no reason for them to stay, that most of the people in Paaran Disen had already fled and that the Da'Shain have another part to play now. Solinda tells Jonai to take the things the Aes Sedai had given them and to keep moving until they find a place of safety where no one can harm them and he agrees. Solinda makes him promise to keep the Covenant and that even if the Da'Shain lose everything else he must see that they keep the Way of the Leaf. Jonai is shocked by this entreaty because the Covenant was the Aiel and the Aiel were the Covenant, to abandon the Way of the Leaf would be to abandon who they are. Solinda then says she wants him far away by tomorrow and begs him to leave and goes back to the argument. Jonai bows his way out of the room thinking that he would never see them again. He goes back to the wagons, thousands of them loaded with food and water, Chora cuttings and the crated angreal, sa'angreal and ter'angreal that the Aes Sedai had given them - all things that had to be kept from the male channelers in their madness. A group of the waiting Aiel come to meet him asking whether the Aes Sedai had granted leave for any of them to stay behind. He tells them \"no\" and that they must obey. He returns to his wagon and his family. His wife Alnora looks worried and he asks her if everything is all right and if she dreamed. Alnora replies that she had dreamed but of no time soon and that everything will be well. Jonai then signals the other wagons and the Aiel begins to leave Paren Disen."

He can see across to the next field where the same is happening. Coumin had just turned 16 and the women had decided that his voice was finally deep enough for him to join in the singing. There are soldiers (men and Ogier) around the field too and Coumin is fascinated by them because they actually kill. His great-grandfather claimed that there was a time without soldiers but he did not believe that because who would kill the Trollocs. But his great-grandfather also claimed there hadn't been any Trollocs then either. He always said that Lanfear had not always been evil but Coumin wished he wouldn't as people would look at him and Coumin didn't like that. One of the Nym was approaching. It was Someshta, he was head and shoulders taller than the Ogier and where he trod he left footprints filled with sprouting plants. Coumin wondered if he could ask Someshta about his great-grandfather's stories. Someshta would know, he was old, some said the Nym never died, not so long as plants grew. The Ogier stood and began to sing, then the Aiel begins singing and Someshta begins to dance across the field. The women were clapping to urge the men on. He is caught up in the singing and could see that wherever the Nym had trodden were now green sprouts. Coumin believes that this was what he was born for, to sing. The song begins to fade slowly and then stops\u200b and the women were coming to congratulate them. Coumin catches the eye of a lone soldier standing by Tomada, one of the Ogier. He goes to talk to the soldier asking if there is any news. The soldier says he has an unconfirmed report that Lews Therin has led the companions on a strike at Shayol Ghul this morning at dawn. Something is disrupting communications but the report was that the Bore was sealed with most, if not all of the Forsaken on the other side. Tomada says that at last it is over. The soldier replies yes and that the local folk could not wait to go off and celebrate. But there are still Trollocs and Nightriders even though the Forsaken are gone. Coumin is stunned, as is the soldier. But Tomada does not appear excited at all. Coumin cannot imagine the world without war and decides he must talk to his great-grandfather - Charn. He is on his way back to the inn when he is attacked and struck in the face by a townsman. The townsman spits at him and says that Lanfear will not protect them anymore and that they will root out all those who served the Forsaken while pretending to be on the side of light and treat the lot of them like they treated that crazy old man. Then a woman comes and pulls him away. Coumin runs to the inn looking for Charn to find that Charn has been murdered and has been hanged. Coumin is devastated and cannot understand why this has happened."

Jo-cars are humming down the street and a great white sho-wing darts across the sky carrying people to Comelle or Tzora or somewhere. He seldom used sho-wings - if he needed to go very far an Aes Sedai normally Travelled with him but he would use one tonight to go to M'Jinn. Today was his 25th naming day and tonight he intended to accept Nalla's latest offer of marriage. It would mean changing his service to Zorelle Sedai whom Nalla served but Mierin Sedai had already given her blessing. As Charn rounds a corner he collides with a man and ends up crashing to the ground. The man shouts at him to watch where he is going. The woman with him takes his arm and points out that the person he has knocked down is Aiel. The man apologizes and helps Charn up. As he is righted the ground began to ripple under their feet and the air ripples too in spreading waves. The man looks uncertain and asks Charn what it is. Charn does not answer but pushes past and through the crowd of people that have gathered, his eyes fixed on the Sharom, the white sphere high above the Collam Daan. Mierin had said that today was the day, that she had found a new source for the One Power. Female and male Aes Sedai would be able to tap the same Source, what men and women could do united, would be greater, and today she and Beidomon would tap it for the first time. What seemed like a tiny chip of white spun away from the Sharom in a jet of black fire, it descended, deceptively slowly and began to drift down, falling, in an obsidian inferno. Darkness spread across the sky swallowing the sun in an unnatural light. People are screaming everywhere. With the first spurt of fire Charn breaks into a run towards the Collam Daan, but he knows he is too late. He was sworn to serve Aes Sedai but he was too late, tears were rolling down his face as he ran."

He is at the edge of the columns staring at Avendesora. There is no sign of Muradin and Rand did not think he would ever come out. Suddenly something in the tree catches his eye. A man hanging from the tree with a rope around his neck. With a wordless roar he runs for the tree, grabbing at saidin, the fiery sword coming into his hands he leaps and slashes at the rope. He and Mat hit the floor with a thud and the pole that Mat had been suspended from clattered to the ground. It is not just a pole but was an odd spear with a short sword blade in place of the spear-point. Rand lets the power go and rips the rope away from Mat's neck and pressed an ear to his chest. He rips open Mat's coat and shirt and tears away the medallion that's hanging around Mat's neck. There is no heart beat. He hammers against Mat's chest - nothing. Hammers again until there is a faint heart beat. Rand fights to keep Mat alive following a memory of what he had seen Master Luhhan do once when reviving a boy who had been found floating in the Winespring Water. Mat jerks and coughs and rolls onto his side. Mat curses and says \"they tried to kill me\" Rand asks who he is talking about. Mat tells him about the twisted doorway and that they cheated and tried to kill him. Mat picks up the medallion (a silver foxhead) and stuffs it in his pocket and grabs the spear, running his fingers along the script on the shaft saying it's their joke but he will keep it anyway. Rand asks him what he means and Mat says that it's what it says on the spear and that his head is spinning. Rand looks at the text and cannot read it and wonders how Mat can. But he suggests that they go back.\nAs he leaves Rand looks at the two figurines of a man and a woman holding crystal spheres but decides to leave them until he needs them. As they start to leave the dust starts to ripple but there is no wind. They start to run. Rand brings the Power sword back although he is uncertain what he can do with it against shivering lines of dust. Rand realizes that it's a bubble of evil. The dust continues to ripple suddenly rearing up into the solid shape of a man, which leaps at them. Rand slices through the figure which dissolves into dust but is quickly replaced by others. Rand and Mat fight against them, Rand channels creating a whirlwind in the middle of the shapes and they explode into clouds of dust. They run as the dust begins to ripple again and they keep slashing at the dust until they break out into the dim light. Nothing is following them from the fog. Mat exclaims that they have been in there all night and that the sun is nearly rising. Rand stares at the sky and thinks \"He will come from Rhuidean at dawn and tie you with bonds you cannot break\" (something he has read earlier in one of the prophecies). He says to Mat that they should go back up the mountain as the Wise Ones will be waiting."

He and Gaul are following behind Loial and the others because Perrin is still angry about Faile coming along and Faile is still refusing to let him be part of her and Loial's party. Perrin won't even let himself acknowledge that it's Faile's group he and Gaul are following. As they continue he observes that the Ways do not seem to bother the Aiel man but Perrin is alert and listening for the slightest sound of Machin Shin, knowing that his ears will be the first to pick up any sound. Perrin notices that Faile and Loial's party in front have stopped so he draws rein in the middle of the bridge he was crossing. He notices that the bridge looks like it is about to crumble underneath him. The horses are nervous and Perrin sympathizes with them and thinks that it would be more comforting if there were more people around. But regardless of his feelings he will not go closer to the small group of people ahead of him. Not after what had happened on the island just after they had left Tear.\nHe remembers the event... Perrin had led his horse Stepper over to the Guiding and he walked around the island studying the bridges leading from it. Gaul had seemed to not be at all bothered by being in the Ways. When Loial had arrived on the island with Faile she had immediately hopped from her horse and strode over to Perrin with a very fixed expression and he began to speak to her but she slapped him across the face and told him off for going on and rushing off like a wild boar. He says that he had asked her not to do that and she hits him again. Faile had been furious with Perrin for going off ahead and with Loial for trying to intervene and also furious with Bain and Chiad for not intervening. Bain had replied that she did not think that Faile would have wanted them to seeing as she had picked the fight herself. Faile then had seemed to lose her anger toward Perrin, which had made him nervous. She had stared at him then with unshed tears in her eyes.\nGaul brings Perrin back to the present by telling him that the party in front were moving again. And they carry along their way down the next ramp. Perrin muses to himself that he hates the ramps, sided by darkness and seeming to curve in circles with no visible means of support. Gaul is looking slightly confused at the next island as it seems that they are directly below the one they had just left and Perrin is glad that he is not the only one to notice. Once more Faile and Loial stop by the Guiding but they do not move on. Faile calls to Perrin asking him to come over. He goes over and asks what she wants and she tells him that she just wanted to see if he would come when she called. She smiles at him, Perrin thinks probably because she heard his teeth grinding. Perrin scrubs at his nose as he has noticed a faint rank smell. Gaul chuckles and comments on the way of women and how it is easier to understand the sun as a woman. Bain whispers to Chiad and they both laugh and from the way the two women look at him and Gaul, Perrin thinks he would rather not know what they were laughing at.\nLoial says that was not the reason at all and that the real reason is because they have arrived. He points to the Guiding and tells them it is the Waygate to Manetheren. Perrin nods, not wanting to suggest anything for fear of Faile's reaction. He rubs his nose again because of the smell of rankness. Then suddenly his ears pick up the distant sound of hooves and the smell hits home to him. He shouts that there are Trollocs. Gaul reacts and immediately kills one of the approaching monsters. A fight begins with all of them defending themselves against the Trollocs, until they have defeated them all. Perrin looks around and assesses everyone's injuries - he is glad to see that Faile is unhurt. He believes the only reason they managed to fend them all off is due to the Trollocs' eyesight not adjusting quickly enough coming from the darkness into the light of the lanterns. They have only moments respite before a Fade leaps into the light. The Aiel fight the Fade, Gaul with his spear and Bain and Chiad shooting at it with their arrows. Suddenly one of Faile's knives blossoms in the Fade's face but the Fade does not give in. Perrin manages to swing at it with his hammer and it goes down. They leave the Fade thrashing wildly on the floor.\nPerrin could hear more Trollocs approaching and tells the others that they have to hurry to the Waygate. Faile turns about and heads off much to Perrin's surprise and he asks her why she isn't arguing. She replies that it's because he is speaking sense. As they head towards the gate Perrin's ears catch another sound, like a sighing, which sends shivers into his bones. The sound is getting louder and Perrin calls to Loial to hurry - he has heard the sound too now and rushes to open the gate. The gate opens up and Loial urges Faile through and Perrin tells the Aiel to follow her, that they cannot fight this. Perrin asks Loial if he can lock the gate at all and he replies that he can but they must hurry. By the sound of the Trollocs muttering they have heard the sound of Machin Shin too. Perrin backs Stepper through the Waygate. The Aiel had spread out across the slope facing the Waygate with arrows knocked and ready. Faile is picking herself up from where she had tumbled from going too fast through the Waygate. Loial comes hurtling through with two Trollocs on his heels but before the Trollocs were halfway out the shimmering surface of the gate, it turns black, Perrin could hear voices wailing madness in his head, the Trollocs are beating at the boiling blackness until it had sucked them back in and the Waygate closed. Loial rushes forward and replaces the two Avendesora leaves on this side of the gate to lock it. He tells Perrin that it is the best that he can do and that now the gate can only be opened from the outside. He says he could have locked it permanently by not replacing the leaves but that he could not ruin a Waygate because he hopes that one day they can be cleansed of Machin Shin. Perrin tells him it will do and he wonders if it was just coincidence that the Trollocs were there or if they had been heading for that Waygate.\nFaile is unsteady and the Aiel look shaken for once. Faile asks was it Machin Shin and Loial replies that it was. Perrin looks around and identifies that they are in the Mountains of Mist and he watches two white-winged hawks wheeling above the valley. Perrin's eyes catch the streak of an arrow and one of the hawks went cart-wheeling from the sky. Perrin frowns and cannot imagine why anyone would be shooting hawks up on the mountain. The second hawk swooped after his mate and then starts climbing desperately. A cloud of black ravens bursts up from the trees and surrounds it and when the ravens settled again the hawk is gone. Perrin is disturbed by this as he knows that the Dark One uses ravens and other creatures as his spies. Faile asks him what he is staring at and he replies just birds. He doesn't want to alarm them right after their escape from the Ways. Perrin dropped down from Stepper and cleaned the blood from his hammer and from himself. Faile begins to tend to his wounds for him. The cuts on his face are small but Faile needs to stitch the gash in his side. She grumbles the whole time she is tending him. Perrin dresses in clean clothes while Faile stands fingering the slash in his coat. He reaches for the coat and she flings it at him saying he better not expect her to sew that as well and she goes off to help tend the others. Perrin sends his mind questing out over the valley searching for wolves. He thinks that way he will get answers on who is in the forest and whether there are any more Trollocs. But he is surprised to find no wolves at all. They should have been there, as there had always been wolves in the Mountains of Mist, but they aren't. He hopes he can find the wolves tomorrow and doesn't want to think about what the alternatives are if he can't.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

              "pov_summary": "Perrin and the others camp on the mountain outside the Waygate. Faile insists on there being two camps but Loial refuses and says that all of that is done with now. Faile remains stubborn and Perrin tells Loial that he will camp further away and motions him back to the women. Gaul joins Perrin and they look over to the other camp. The women are laughing together and Loial seems to be trying to hide in his book whilst keeping some distance from them. Perrin thinks that Faile believes they are far enough away for the Ogier not to hear and that they probably haven't realised that they are embarrassing him with their chatter. Gaul says to Perrin that this place looks more like the three-fold land than any other in the Wetlands and that it does not seem as strange to him as what they call forests. Perrin wishes to see Gaul's land and Gaul thinks that maybe some day he might. Gaul asks Perrin if this is where Manetheren stood and whether he is one of its blood, to which Perrin replies yes it/he is but that they are no longer a nation of great warriors. Gaul smiles and comments that he has seen Perrin and the other Two Rivers boys fight and that he disagrees. Perrin is surprised that Gaul knows about Manetheren but Gaul says that he read many books before crossing the Dragonwall although many things he had underestimated. Gaul then asks Perrin if he thinks it was chance that there were Trollocs heading for this Waygate and Perrin says no and that he had also seen ravens. Perrin feels out for the wolves again but finds nothing. He tells Gaul that he may find out something tonight but that he may need kicking awake if necessary. Perrin realises that this is a very strange thing to say but Gaul just accepts it like he accepts that the colour of Perrin's eyes are different, without comment.\nPerrin goes to sleep and seeks the Wolf Dream. He finds himself near the Waygate in daylight but wearing the hammer on his belt instead of his axe. He frowns at it and the axe momentarily flickers back into place but does not last long and the hammer reappears. He doesn't remember that ever happening before but thinks that the wolf dream is full of oddities. As though the thought triggered it a dark patch of sky appeared, a window to somewhere else. Rand stood amid swirling storm winds laughing madly, arms upraised, hidden eyes watched him and Perrin could not tell if Rand knew or not. The window winked out and another appears, further over this time, showing Nynaeve and Elayne stalking through a landscape of twisted shadowed buildings hunting some dangerous beast. Perrin didn't know how he knew it was dangerous but he was certain of it. That window also winks out and another appears. Mat is standing at a fork in a road, he flips a coin and starts down one branch and suddenly he is wearing a wide brimmed hat and walking with a staff bearing a short sword blade. Another window appears and he sees Egwene and a woman with long white hair, they both stare at him in surprise while behind them the White Tower crumbles stone by stone, then they are gone too.\nPerrin had seen these windows before and thought that they were real in some way or that they meant something. The wolves never saw them. Moiraine had suggested that the wolf dream was like Tel'aran'rhiod and then would say no more. Perrin calls out for Hopper but he does not come, so he carries on to see what he can find out. He \"steps\" into the spot where he had seen the ravens earlier and then makes his way east towards the Two Rivers looking for wolves. He calls for Hopper again but he does not come. Perrin is troubled because he can't even sense any wolves, but there are always other wolves somewhere in the wolf dream. Perrin suddenly sees another man standing on top of a hill, he is too far away to see clearly but he is tall with dark hair and is wearing a blue coat with a bow on his back, but Perrin feels there is something familiar about him. He catches the man's scent and he smells cold and something not really human. The man looks up and sees Perrin then disappears in a streak across the hills. Perrin leaps down to where the man had been and finds a half-skinned corpse of a wolf. Perrin is shocked that a wolf has been killed here in the wolf dream, something very evil must be responsible. Perrin chases the man until he sees a metal tower sparkling in the sun. The man heads straight for it and Perrin follows. Perrin can find no way into the tower but it also smells of that cold inhuman scent.\nPerrin feels a raw emotion and his brain identifies it in one word - stop! It is Hopper. He tells Perrin that he is chasing the Slayer, who is here in flesh and can kill and also that there are other things of the shadow walking the dream and it is no longer safe. Hopper tells him he cannot chase Slayer into the tower and kill him because Slayer kills. Perrin senses a finality about the way \"kills\" is said and asks Hopper what happens if a wolf dies in the dream. Hopper tells him that wolves that die in the dream die forever. Perrin hears a voice behind him and spins around. A woman is there and she tells him that the Tower of Ghenjei is a bad place for humankind. The woman has her golden hair braided and is wearing wide yellow trousers and boots and carrying a silver bow which she hides under her cloak when she sees Perrin notice it. He asks if she is Aes Sedai, and she says that no, she only came to warn him, despite the prescripts. Once entered the Tower of Ghenjei is hard enough to leave in the world of men but here it is almost impossible. He asks what the Tower of Ghenjei is and that Hopper had told him of it. She is surprised that he can talk to wolves. She tells him that it is a doorway to the realms of the Aelfinn and the Eelfinn as though he should know who they are. Perrin looks at her blankly so she asks him has he ever played the game Snakes & Foxes. He says that he did as a child until he figured out there was no way to win. She says the only way is to break the rules and then she recites from the game \"courage to strengthen, fire to blind, music to daze, iron to bind\" Perrin says he does not understand what this has to do with the tower. She says that the game is a remembrance of old dealings and that it does not matter as long as he stays away from the Aelfinn and the Eelfinn. The woman also says that they are not evil in the way that the Shadow is evil but that they are so different from humankind that they might as well be and they are not to be trusted. That he should stay away from the Tower of Ghenjei and to avoid the World of Dreams if he can because dark things walk there. Perrin asks if she means Slayer. She says that Slayer is a good name for him, that he is not old but that his evil is ancient. Then she stops and says she doesn't understand why she's telling him all this. Then she seems to think for a second and then asks him if he is ta'veren. Perrin does not answer but asks who she is and that he feels he has met her somewhere before. The woman replies that she has broken too many of the prescripts already. He asks her what prescripts but is distracted by a shadow behind him - a man with two sword hilts rising above his shoulders - and something about him is familiar too. The woman says that the man is right and she should not be talking to Perrin and she disappears. Perrin frowns at Hopper and asks what he thinks of her. Hopper is confused as he had not seen her, only Perrin talking to the air. Perrin tells Hopper that he has come away from what he intended and explains his need to find wolves in the Two Rivers. Hopper remains silent for a while and then tells Perrin that he should not go home, there are no wolves there now and those who did not flee are dead. Slayer walks the dream there. Perrin says he has to go home and Hopper tells him to take care and that the day of the Last Hunt draws near and that they will run together in the Last Hunt.\nPerrin opens his eyes. Gaul is on watch over him and Faile is awake at the other camp taking her turn at guard. He tells Gaul that he will take guard for a while and that things may be worse in the Two Rivers than he'd thought. Gaul replies that things often are and that it is the way of life."

              "pov_summary": "The journey into the Westwood lasts three days. The Aiel had no trouble keeping up and Perrin's wounds itched fiercely as they healed. Perrin is glad that he saw no more ravens. Several times he thought that Faile was going to bring her horse closer to talk to him but she restrained herself each time. Loial is still riding with her at Perrin's request. Perrin is worrying about whether Slayer walks the Two Rivers in the waking world as well as in the Wolf Dream, but suspects that he did both. Perrin thinks about his family and worries that if the Whitecloaks are looking for Aybaras then they would be easy to find.\nHe could have headed straight for Emond's Field but he goes northward to the Quarry Road instead. Perrin smelled the farm before he sees it, a smell of char, not new, but still strong. He reins in and sits staring before he can make himself ride into what had been the al'Thor farm. Only the stone-walled sheep pen still stands and the tumbled burnt beams of the farmhouse. He realizes that the fire was weeks old and everything is covered in vines. The Aiel search the ruins carefully and Bain returns from the ruins and indicates that there is no sign of anyone inside. Perrin is glad that Tam had not died there and it is all that he could do to stop himself setting Stepper to a gallop and riding all the way to his own family's farm but he knows that the horse would never make it all that way. Gaul reports that whoever did this was long gone but that he thinks two men came back and drove the remaining sheep away north. Faile rides over to him and asks if he knew who lived there. He tells her it was Rand and his father. She is relieved and sympathetic, then asks if his family live nearby. He curtly says no and turns his back on her to speak to Gaul. He says they will have to camp close and that he wants an early start in the morning and that the people in Emond's Field will know what's going on. Gaul hesitates and says to Perrin that he will not be able to drive Faile off, that she is almost Far Dareis Mai and that if a Maiden loves you, you cannot escape her. Perrin quietly tells Gaul that they will leave early, while Faile is still asleep.\nPerrin and Gaul set off before first light and one of the Aiel women watches them go. Perrin is thankful that whichever of them it was, they did not wake Faile. Perrin circles around east, wide of the village to avoid most of the people. He notices that the damage he remembers from Winternight is all gone and repaired. They head for the inn and tie the horse at the kitchen door and enter. Perrin peeks in at the common room door and sees Bran and Marin al'Vere cleaning. He thinks they\u200b both look troubled and the Mayor is frowning as he works. Perrin enters and speaks, making them jump. They are both shocked. Marin asks after Egwene and Perrin tells her that she is fine and in Tar Valon with Nynaeve. Marin says she knows and has received letters and that it seems like she has friends - Elayne and Min - and if Perrin has met them. He says that he has and reassures Marin that they are nice. Then he introduces Gaul. Bran asks Perrin why he has returned and he replies that he had heard about the Whitecloaks. Bran tells him it would be best if he goes away again as quietly as he had come. Perrin says he cannot go and that he intends to give himself up in the hope this will help his family. The hall door bangs and everyone jumps as Faile, Bain and Chiad enter. Perrin wonders where Loial is but he doesn't have too much time to think on it as Faile, quivering in outrage, yells at him about giving himself up and why on earth are the Whitecloaks so interested in him anyway. Perrin says it's because he killed some of them and they think he is a Darkfriend. Faile continues to berate him until Mistress al'Vere quietly asks Perrin to introduce her to his friend. Faile starts to blush and apologizes profusely and introduces Bain and Chiad. In short order Marin has them all sat down at the table and drinking tea. Perrin is surprised that Marin does not mention their weapons as she normally insists they are set aside before sitting at her table. His second shock is when Bran gives him a large cup of apple brandy, not the small tot that men normally drink, which he would never have been offered before he left.\nThe Mayor tells him that no one believes he is a Darkfriend but Perrin says that the Whitecloaks want him or any Aybara they can find. Mistress al'Vere says that they already know this and Bran tells him that his family is gone. Perrin is surprised that the farm is burned already but maybe he can help the family rebuild and where they are staying. Bran has to come straight to the point and says that they are dead. Perrin is stunned and asks if he is sure. Bran replies that he is, that he helped bury them himself, everyone from the farm, all under the apple trees. Mistress al'Vere tells him it was the Trollocs and that they came back and have been attacking the outlying farms, most of the people have come into the village and that the Whitecloaks have been their only protection. Then Perrin asks if it was the Trollocs at Rand's farm and Bran says that no, the Whitecloaks did that and the Cauthon place and that Abell and Tam are hiding in the Westwood and that Mat's mother and sister are also alive. Marin also tells Perrin that Daise Congar is now the Wisdom. Gaul says to Bran that he can see by his face there is more to tell. Bran tells them that Padan Fain is with the Whitecloaks but he calls himself Ordeith and will not answer to his old name. Perrin replies that he is a Darkfriend and it was him that brought the Trollocs on Winternight. Bran thinks that this is interesting because Fain seems to have some authority with the Whitecloaks and explains that it was Fain that led them to the al'Thor farm and Tam only just got to the Cauthons in time to stop them taking Abell but Natti and the girls and both the Luhhans were captured and being held in their camp at Watch Hill. Bran says that Fain seems to hate the three boys and that Lord Bornhald is always asking after Perrin when he comes down with the Whitecloak patrols. Chiad asks can the village not protect itself rather than relying on the Whitecloaks. Bran says that they are only simple people and that Lord Luc speaks of organising men to fight but that means leaving families unprotected. Perrin asks who this Lord Luc is and they say that he came at about the same time as the Whitecloaks, that he is a Hunter of the Horn, but that he has given up his hunt to help them. Perrin asks Faile if she knows this Lord Luc as she is also a Hunter of the Horn, but she refuses to answer and says that she has had enough and tells him he must grieve for his family. She gets up and goes to Perrin and he suddenly realises that he is leaning against her and crying whilst she comforts him.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

When he finally comes back to himself he and Faile are alone. Faile takes his hands and sits next to him. Perrin wonders how he can make up to her for how he has treated her. She asks him if he has given up the idea of surrendering to the Whitecloaks and he says it seems that it wouldn't do any good if he does and that he has to get the Luhhans and Mat's family free and do what he can about the Trollocs. She says she is glad and if he has any more fool notions about sending her away. He replies no. Then she says that they are five people, six if Loial is willing and if they can find Tam and Abell that will be eight and that is a beginning, maybe others will join them. The she says he will want to go to visit his family's farm and she would go with him if he allows it. But he says he will do that later (as he could not bear to see the graves now) and that the first thing they must do is find Tam and Abell.\nMaster al'Vere puts his head back in the common room and looking bemused, says to Perrin that there is an Ogier in the kitchen, drinking tea, and that maybe Marin could pretend that Aiel walk in there every day but she nearly fainted when she saw Loial and that he'd given her a double tot of brandy and that he thinks she'd have had another if offered. Perrin asks him if he knows where Tam and Abell are and Bran says that all he knows is that they are in the Westwood. The three go into the kitchen to find Loial and the Aiel sitting cross-legged on the floor and Mistress al'Vere bustling around pretending all this is normal. Loial seems relieved to see Perrin and tells him he is sorry for his loss, and also that he will sing to the apple trees before they leave if Perrin wishes. Bran and Marin look stunned and Perrin thanks Loial and says he would appreciate it, but that he has work to do before he can leave the Two Rivers and tells them of his plans. He says that he will appreciate if they do not want to stay with him and particularly to Loial he says that he will not finish his book here. Loial replies that here or there doesn't matter, that he thinks that it is all the same fight and maybe he will write a chapter about Perrin. Gaul says that he owes Perrin a blood debt and he means to stay with him. Bain and Chiad look to Faile who nods and they also then reply that they will stay. Mistress al'Vere tells them they are all foolish and stubborn and that they will probably all end up on the gallows. When they only look at her she says that if they are foolish enough to stay then she has better show them where to hide. Bran tells her he thought they could hide in the old sickhouse and Marin looks at him startled as though she is surprised that he thought of it and says that it will do for tonight. Then she adds that she will take them there. Bran says there is no need for her to go and that he can take them if Perrin doesn't remember the way. Marin replies that sometimes he forgets he is Mayor and that he attracts attention, maybe he should stay here and pretend that all is normal, and to forget that the old sickhouse exists.\nMarin instructs them to travel in smaller parties and that she will cross the village alone and meet them in the woods on the other side. The Aiel assure her they could find the lightning split oak that she described and slip out the back door. Perrin is sure he can find the sickhouse himself but Marin insists on everyone meeting at the oak and she would take them. Marin then asks Loial if he would possibly wear his cloak with the hood up and he says that yes he can, that way he will not be so easily spotted and then they all go out to the stableyard.\nCenn Buie is there examining the horses and then he catches sight of Loial, immediately thinking him a Trolloc. Marin tells him not to be a fool and that Master Loial is an Ogier passing through the village. Then Cenn notices Perrin and says that he's a Darkfriend and that they're after him and last time they had Trollocs was when he'd run off with Aes Sedai, he asks what's wrong with his eyes and if he brought back some sickness to kill them all. Perrin feels Faile drawing her knife and reaches out to steady her. Marin tells Cenn he's to keep this to himself. Cenn says he means to take this up with the Council because they are all in danger as long as Perrin is there. Marin tells him that it is Women's Circle business and if Cenn even dares to call her a liar and flaps his tongue she'll have his wife make him sleep in the barn with no food and if he thinks for a minute that Council takes precedence over Circle she'll send Daise Congar to sort him out. Cenn agrees to keep quiet and slinks away grumbling. Faile says that she might need to take lessons from Marin as she doesn't handle Perrin nearly that well and Marin says that if you let them have their way when it's less important they are unlikely to give you trouble when you check them on important things. Then adds that they had best be on their way.\nThey all cross the village in their parties and make it to the oak. The Maidens and Gaul are eyeing each other almost as much as they are eyeing the woods around them. Mistress al'Vere insists they go the rest of the way on foot and also that they all stay together. Suddenly Perrin senses someone else ahead and reaches for his quiver. Marin tells them to be at ease and abruptly two men appear both in cloaks that appeared to fade into the surrounding woods. Perrin recognises them as Warders and questions Marin as to why she didn't tell them there was an Aes Sedai and why Bran had not mentioned it. Marin says because Bran doesn't know and that it is Women's Circle business she then turns to the Warders, Tomas and Ihvon and tells them to let her pass. The grey-haired Warder remarks about the Ogier and recognises Perrin as the one the Whitecloaks seek and Ihvon goes to get the Aes Sedai while Tomas waits with the group. Perrin muses on whether he could get the Aes Sedai to help him and they all wait.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

He recognizes both of the Sisters. The first one is Verin Mathwin, a Brown and one of the few sisters besides Moiraine who know about Rand. The second one is a Green named Alanna Mosvani. He has seen her once but never met her. Mistress al'Vere apologizes to the Aes Sedai for bringing them unannounced but Verin tells her it is all right. If she is surprised to see him in the company of an Ogier and three Aiel, she doesn't show it.\nAlanna agrees as long as she doesn't make it a habit. She wants to know if Perrin is alone but he replies with a question of his own. 'Why are you here?' Both Faile and Marin disapprove of his attitude towards the Aes Sedai. Perrin's question stands though. Trollocs, Whitecloaks and Aes Sedai in the Two Rivers, that can't be a coincidence. The Aes Sedai explain that they were looking for girls who can channel. After Egwene and Nynaeve came to the White Tower it was clear that there had to be more. The Whitecloaks managed to kill one of Alanna's warders and are preventing anyone from leaving the Two Rivers. Perrin wants to know why they don't do something about the situation but they answer that even an Aes Sedai can only do so much.\nAlanna notices he is injured and Bain tells her it happened when they came out of the Waygate. Verin had already guessed that was how the Trollocs came to the Two Rivers. Loial tells her the Waygate is now locked until someone opens it from the outside. Alanna heals Perrin and the other wounded in his company.\nTam al'Thor and Abell Cauthon join them in the sickhouse. They are glad to see Perrin and want to hear how their sons are doing. Perrin does not feel free to speak in front of the Aes Sedai so they walk into the woods to talk. They joke a little about his beard and Faile. When they are out of earshot they exchange news. Tam and Abell went to Tar Valon to find out what happened to the boys but they didn't get a lot of information. Tam tries to tell Perrin the bad news about his family too, but Perrin says he already knows. Halfway through the conversation they spot a raven and kill it. Ravens seem to be everywhere in the Two Rivers at the moment. Tam also tells Perrin about a man who has been killing animals for no apparent reason. Perrin assumes this is Slayer but he doesn't mention it to the two men. Then the conversation turns to the Whitecloaks. Perrin tells them he intends to free the people they hold and then turn the Two Rivers into a dying ground for Trollocs. Both Abell and Tam are troubled by these plans."

As they approach Watch Hill he sees a group of Travelling People getting ready to move. He tells one of his lieutenants to go tell their Seeker, a man named Raen, that he will take his people south. He won't let anybody get out of the Two Rivers. His eyes then wander to the place where the prisoners are kept. He considers letting the Questioners have a go at them.

He is surprised that Verin will actually join him on this trip but he'd rather have her where he can keep an eye on her so he doesn't protest. Alanna stays behind as does Loial. He really wants to go but he would simply attract too much attention. Faile assumes she is welcome on this trip and much to her surprise Perrin tells her he'd enjoy her company. The three Aiel, still refusing to ride, will keep up with the party from the woods beside the road. They'll have to stay out of sight so they won't attract any attention.\nPerrin sees an abandoned farmhouse just outside of the Westwood. The people who lived there decided it was time to move away from the woods. Perrin asks Tam how many Trollocs he thinks there are in the Two Rivers. His initial response is two hundred but when he thinks about it a bit longer he admits there are probably more. When the conversation turns to what the Trollocs are actually trying to accomplish Verin joins the conversation. None of them can come up with a good explanation though. Maybe it is a lure of some kind.\nFor midday they stop at the al'Seen farm for a meal and to breathe the horses. Tam and Abell, who are still wanted by the Whitecloaks trust the al'Seens enough to join. The Aiel again have to stay out of sight. But despite having to keep up with the horses through the woods they have managed to hunt a bit. They will have their own meal. The al'Seen farm is crowded, despite being a big farm. The al'Seens have taken in the residents of two farms closer to the Westwood.\nPerrin spots a number of people he knows. One of them, Wil al'Seen seems to be very taken with Faile. When Perrin goes to say hello Wil notices the axe though. Faile is amused by Wil's reaction to Perrin. Faile, Verin and her Warder Tomas are a bit of a curiosity to the Two Rivers people. They don't get to see a lot of outsiders. Talk turns to recent events and the Whitecloaks spreading rumours that Perrin, Mat and Rand are Darkfriends. Not that the al'Seens believe that of course. Perrin explains to them what he thinks about the Whitecloaks and that he has been forced to kill some of them. Killing is very rare in the Two Rivers. People are somewhat shocked by this. Perrin also tells them the man they knew as Padan Fain is with the Whitecloaks and that he knows him to be a Darkfriend. The al'Seens hesitate to believe this at first, but Perrin is still one of their own. After that the midday meal is ready and everybody turns their attention to the food. During the meal the boys who have kept watch from the roof of one of the buildings report that Lord Luc is approaching."

              "pov_summary": "Perrin despises Lord Luc immediately. The man has the arrogance of a nobleman about him. The Two Rivers' folk don't seem to notice his slightly condescending attitude though. They adore him. He claims to be from a minor House in Murandy and to be taking part in the Hunt for the Horn. He seems to recognize Verin for what she is and is not pleased to see her. Faile on the other hand he likes a lot. Much to Perrin's disliking she seems to be charmed by him.\nLord Luc has been telling the people to stand up to the Whitecloaks and the Trollocs. Giving them advice on how to defend their farms. The advice he has been giving makes no sense to Perrin whatsoever. He tells the Two Rivers folk that as long as they stay at their own farms, spread out in groups of twenty or fifty they'll be easy targets for both the Whitecloaks and the Trollocs. Lord Luc, clearly getting defensive now, wants to know what Perrin thinks they should do about that. He tells the people they should pack up and gather at one place. Watch Hill, or even better Emond's Field since there is no Whitecloak camp there. This triggers protests from the farmers who don't want to leave their fields behind. But, as Perrin points out to them, farms can be rebuilt and fields replanted. People are irreplaceable. Seeing the mood among the people change, Lord Luc decides it is a good time to leave.\nWhen Perrin and company are ready to go, the people are packing up ready to leave for Emond's Field today. Four boys join Perrin's company to try to get the Two Rivers people being held by the Whitecloaks free. Faile is impressed by Perrin's performance and comes to tell him she shouldn't have tried to make him jealous. Of course she does it in such a way he is still left guessing at what she means. Verin is very interested to see a ta'veren in action.\nOn the way to Watch Hill they stop at a number of other farms to give them the same advice. Every time the people are packing before Perrin moves on. They pick up more young men as well. When they start bickering among themselves Perrin tries to imitate Uno and sets them straight on what it is they are going to do. It seems to work just fine. Verin is taking notes and both Faile and Tam nod approvingly.\nWhen they get to Watch Hill Perrin goes to take a look at the situation. The prisoners are held in a tent in the middle of the camp. The Aiel, Perrin and Faile are going to attempt to rescue them. Without thinking Perrin gives Tam and Abell orders to settle down the other men but to make sure they are ready to go instantly. When he realizes what he is doing he tries to apologize to both men but they seem amused and tell him he is doing just fine. They agree on a hiding place for the freed prisoners so now all there is left to do is wait.\nWhen the sun is down they get on their way. Perrin cautions the Aiel to try and not kill anyone. The Whitecloaks will be upset enough without that. Perrin and Faile sneak into the camp but one of the Whitecloaks sees them. He brushes Faile aside and tries to strangle Perrin. Faile knocks him out with a piece of firewood without making too much noise. Perrin takes the man's cloak, ties him up and gags him before they move on. They get near the tents just in time to see the Aiel Maidens take out the guards. They sneak in and wake the prisoners. When the prisoners are ready to go and the Whitecloak guards are tied up in the tent, Perrin and Haral and Alsbet Luhhan pretend to escort four prisoners, wearing the white cloaks they took off from the guards. They make it to the picket lines and get everybody on a horse before the alarm is raised. In a mad dash they race out of the camp towards the meeting point.\nPerrin divides them into two groups. Tam, Abell, Faile, the Aiel, and the freed prisoners will ride for the hiding place Tam selected while the rest attempt to draw away the Whitecloak pursuit. Perrin asks Verin if she can help. She informs him she probably didn't do what he had in mind but that he can expect rain in about half an hour. Quite a downpour even. Making as much noise as they can, the Two Rivers band rides off along the North Road. With the prisoners freed it is time to hunt Trollocs."

              "pov_summary": "Rand and Mat stumble through the Waste on their way to the Aiel camp. They both are in bad shape bleeding from several wounds. The day is young yet and they try to get to the camp before the heat of the afternoon sets in. Rand hurries back to the people he must destroy to save the world. Bair is waiting for them at the edge of the camp with a bag of water. Before they can get to her though Couladin demands to know where Muradin is. He accuses Rand and Mat of killing him and the Shaido start flinging spears at them. As a proof Couladin points to Mat's oddly shaped spear and claims they went into the city armed. Bair interferes and attests to the fact neither was armed when they went into Rhuidean.\nBair demands Rand show the signs. It takes a moment for Rand to understand what she means but then he rolls back one of his sleeves and shows them the scarlet-and-gold dragon on his arm. Bair impatiently steps up to Rand and rolls back his other sleeve as well. Another Dragon is revealed. There can be no doubt, Rand is He Who Comes With the Dawn. The Shaido retreat to their tents and Rand and Mat can finally have a drink of water.\nEgwene wants to know what happened but Bair tells them not to speak of their experience in Rhuidean with those who haven't been there. Rand just says it wasn't Muradin that attacked them. He wants to know where Moiraine is. He had expected her here. Egwene tells them she and Aviendha are still in Rhuidean. Lan is very upset over the fact that the Wise Ones hid Moiraine's departure from him. They left the same day Rand and Mat did. It turns out that this was seven days ago. If they are not back by the tenth day they won't be returning.\nIt turns out none of the Wise Ones can Heal so Rand and Mat are taken to a tent where their wounds can be tended with herbs and ointments. Against the wishes of the Wise Ones Rand wants the men to accompany him. Rand asks Rhuarc about what he has seen in Rhuidean and again the Wise Ones tell him it is not permitted to talk of such things before those who haven't experienced them. Rand tells them he intends to change that and after a bit of hesitation Rhuarc answers some of Rand's questions. He says it is different for each man. What Rand saw are ancestral memories. Rand already knew Tam wasn't his father but the fact he is part Aiel has now been driven home. Rhuarc explains a few other things and Rand now sees how the Cairhienin got the privileged position to travel through the Waste without being bothered and how this eventually lead to the Aiel War and Rand being born on the slope of the Dragonmount. Lan wants to know if Rand saw Moiraine and Rand tells him he didn't. Both Lan and Rhuarc warn him to watch out for Couladin. They expect trouble from him and possibly from others as well.\nRand now enters the tent where Mat is already being tended to. He is told to strip to the waist so the Wise Ones can have a look at his wounds. While the Wise Ones take care of him they discuss how to get the clan chiefs to gather. Rhuarc proposes to gather them in a place called Alcair Dal where something like the peace of Rhuidean holds. Mat translates this as the Golden Bowl. Without realizing it, Mat seems to have become fluent in the Old Tongue. Nobody comments on it though. Rhuarc also suggests asking the Wise Ones to visit the clan chiefs in their dreams and summon them to Alcair Dal. The Wise Ones seem hesitant to do this but agree to do it at Rand's request.\nRand switches the conversation to his mother for a bit. Amys knew her and Rand asks her to tell him about her. Amys reveals how Shaiel as the Aiel knew her was found in the Waste close to death because an Aes Sedai by the name of Gitara Moroso had had a Foretelling saying she must dwell among the Maidens of the Spear or a disaster would befall the world. She tells Rand how Shaiel met his father, Janduin, a young clan chief of the Taardad. How they ended up in the Aiel war and she found herself pregnant with his baby and how in spite of Aiel custom she didn't return to the Waste for the delivery but gave birth and died on the slopes of the Dragonmount. Janduin blamed himself for her death and went north to fight in the Blight. He was killed by a man though. He claimed he looked like Shaiel and simply refused to defend himself.\nRand has a lot to think about and for a while they wait in silence for the return of Moiraine and Aviendha. Then a question occurs to Rand. Why, if he is to destroy the Aiel people there aren't more of them plotting against him? It turns out that most Aiel don't know the whole version of the history of the Aiel that is shown to the people who enter Rhuidean. The truth breaks many people that enter there and could break more if it became common knowledge.\nAviendha returns late in the afternoon. The look on her face when she sees Rand makes Mat warn him not to turn his back on her. The Wise Ones take her off and dress her like one of them. Moiraine returns at dusk. Lan is there immediately to take care of her. Rand feels relieved he will not have to wait for three more days but can move soon. Mat asks him what he intends to do. Rand tells him he is going to break the rules."

Elayne is dressed like a Sea Folk woman at sea meaning wide brocaded trousers and no top. Egwene is somewhat shocked to find her like that. Elayne explains that the Sea Folk women wear that at sea and that she wanted to try it. She couldn't do it aboard the ship of course. Not with Thom and Juilin around. Egwene didn't know those two were with Elayne and Nynaeve and Elayne explains they were sent by Lan and Rand to help them. Egwene gives a full report of the Portal Stones, Rhuidean and Rand's true parents. She is worried about Rand. He is as hard as Lan and Rhuarc in some ways and definitely planning something he doesn't want people to know yet.\nShe also tells Elayne Aviendha can channel and that she will be very strong one day. Elayne reveals that some of the Windfinders can channel as well. She has been learning from them and the ship is going fast indeed. They will be in Tanchico in two or three days. She also tells Egwene the Sea Folk think Rand is their Coramoor. They will serve him. Egwene says she wishes the Aiel were as easily convinced. She tells Egwene some of the Aiel may try to kill Rand. Elayne demands she makes sure that doesn't happen.\nEgwene warns Elayne she may not be able to be on time for their next meeting. If that happens she and Nynaeve will have to check the following nights. She will come as soon as there is an opportunity. The conversation turns to Rand again and while Elayne is still in the middle of explaining her doubts and feelings to Egwene, she is dragged off by Amys.\nAmys is very upset with Egwene for lying to her about not going to the World of Dreams unsupervised. She didn't think Aes Sedai could lie. She drags Egwene through a frightening experience in the world of dreams, shielding her from the One Power so Egwene is defenceless. When a frightened and angry Egwene wakes up she finds Amys next to her bed still shielding her. Amys demands that she will not go to Tel'aran'rhiod again alone. Egwene protests and says Amys had no right to drag her out of the World of Dreams. Amys tells her she will refuse to teach her any more if Egwene doesn't agree. She also demands that Egwene braids her hair like an Aiel girl until she proves she can behave like a woman. Egwene sees no other option than to agree and swallow her pride. Only then Amys agrees to accompany her to her next meeting.\nAmys now tells her why she came to get Egwene. The Wise Ones and Moiraine are having a meeting about what to do about Rand. She is taken to a sweat tent where Bair, Melaine, Seana and Moiraine are waiting. Aviendha is there as well tending to the hot stones and steam. Egwene wonders what needs to be done about him. He did fine without guiding so far. This is a clear stab at Moiraine but the Aes Sedai doesn't respond. The Wise Ones say that he doesn't know the Aiel ways and that he must not be seen as an outsider or he may not be accepted. They want to know if he will confide in Egwene. She doubts that. The Wise Ones decide Aviendha will accompany him from the moment he wakes up to the moment he goes to sleep. Her training will have to be rearranged to so she can do this. Aviendha bluntly refuses but the Wise Ones will not have no for an answer. They want to know if there is a reason why she should not. All Aviendha wants to say is that she hates Rand. Egwene manages to convince her to see it as looking after Rand for Elayne.\nWith that taken care of the women relax for a moment. Egwene asks Moiraine if Rhuidean was bad. She says the memories are fading but that she will do what needs to be done to make the Dragon Reborn succeed."

She also tells him to send the Panarch's soldiers away from the palace; when he tells her that it is impossible, she channels again, causing thousands of invisible needles to prick him. She refuses to tell him what she is planning, and then leaves."

Nynaeve is asking Coine where she will next sail, and she answers, \"To Dantora, and the Aile Jafar, and then on to Cantorin and the Aile Somera, spreading news of the Coramoor, if it pleases the Light.\" At the same time, Elayne and Jorin are saying their good-byes.\nAs Nynaeve, Elayne, Thom and Juilin walk down the dock, they see many hungry-faced men, and Elayne thinks that any one of them would kill her if they thought it would mean money for them. As they walk, they hear a familiar voice. \"You! It do be you!\" It is Bayle Domon. He tells them that he waited as long as he could for them in Falme, but \"the time did come when I must sail or watch my ship burn.\" He tells them that he can help them get a room, as Tanchico \"do burst its caulking,\" and they accept. They hire a sedan chair and soon arrive at an inn called The Three Plum Court. They meet the innkeeper, who's name is Rendra; she reminds Nynaeve of Liandrin.\nWhile Nynaeve, Elayne, Thom, Juilin and Bayle Domon eat, Nynaeve tells the captain about their search for the Black Ajah, saying that they may need his help. He reacts almost with despair. \"It do be going to happen again. Falme all over. Maybe it do be time for me to pack up and go.\" After a while, he agrees to help them, and Thom and Juilin proceed to question him about Tanchico.\nNynaeve gives Bayle Domon a list of the Black Ajah members, and descriptions of what they look like; he promises to have his men keep an eye out for them. Bayle Domon then leaves, and Juilin follows him, intending to have a look around Tanchico. Nynaeve goes to get some sleep, and Thom and Elayne go down to the common room. While Thom performs, Elayne watches him and drinks wine. She can't help but think that he seems oddly familiar, though she can't figure out why. Hours later, when Thom stops performing, Elayne rises to go with him...but it turns out that she has become drunk from all the wine. When she finally gets upstairs, she goes to Thom's room. \"I remember,\" she said. \"I was sitting on your knee, and I pulled your mustache...and my mother leaned over your shoulder and laughed at me.\"\nThom tells her that she should go, and that she needs sleep, but Elayne is persistent. \"My mother sat on your knee, too. I saw it. I remember.\" Thom keeps insisting that she needs sleep, but Elayne is on a roll. \"I want to know why Mother sat on your knee. You're a gleeman. My mother would not sit on a gleeman's knee.\" Thom tells her that he used to be the Court Bard in Caemlyn, and Elayne correctly guesses that he was also Morgase's lover. \"I always knew about Gareth Bryne...Gareth Bryne, and you, and this Lord Gaebril Mat said she looks calf-eyes at now...what makes her different from Berelain, tripping every man who catches her eye into her bed.\" Thom becomes angry and slaps her, then explains that it is lonely to be a queen.\nElayne finally makes it into the room that she and Nynaeve are sharing. \"Rand must think I'm crazy, Thom is a bard, and Berelain* isn't my mother after all,\" is her greeting to Nynaeve. Nynaeve proceeds to dunk Elayne's head in a bucket of water and then prepares to go to Tel'aran'rhiod while Elayne watches over her.\n`* In some editions, this quote includes the name of Morgase, in most of the older editions (before 2010) the name is Berelain."

When he meets with Faile, she tells him that everyone is safely in Emond's Field. She also informs him that \"Alanna vanished twice without a word, once alone. Loial said Ihvon seemed surprised to find her gone. He said I wasn't to let anyone else know.\" Perrin isn't sure that he can trust her, or Verin. Faile then tells him that hundreds of people have flocked to Emond's Field due to his warnings and that \"there will be stories about you in the Two Rivers for the next thousand years. Perrin Goldeneyes, hunter of Trollocs.\"\nPerrin ponders over what has happened in the past few days. He and the Two River's lads have been hunting Trollocs; twice, they had ambushed Trolloc camps, the first containing thirty-two Trollocs, the second forty-one and a Fade.\nWhen they join Luc, he is talking to the Two Rivers men and boys, and Wil al'Seen tells Perrin that Luc says they should all go back to Emond's Field. \"We've not smelled a Trolloc in days. Be reasonable, Perrin. Maybe we've killed them all already.\" Perrin tells them that they can go home if they want, but that he will not go home. All of the others decide to stay, as well.\nAround this time, Gaul, Bain and Chiad appear. Gaul tells Perrin that they have found more Trollocs, and that they are moving through the Waterwood to the south. He says that there are no more than thirty. Perrin goads Wil, asking if he will go to Emond's Field while the Trollocs have their supper. Wil is angry at this; \"I will be wherever you are tonight, Aybara.\" Luc, however, says that the defenses of Emond's Field will need him and that he will not stay to fight Trollocs. When he asks if Faile will be joining him, she tells him that she will stay with Perrin.\nWhile they ride, Faile remarks to Perrin that it seems like he does not trust Luc. He replies with \"I trust you and my bow and my axe.\" They ride for two hours, before coming to a stop. They wait for over an hour until the Trollocs finally reach them, attacking from behind. The Two Rivers men engage in battle with the Trollocs, and Perrin fights for revenge for the death of his family. As the battle progresses, it seems that the Perrin's small army is not faring as well as they had hoped. As he fights, Perrin takes an arrow wound in his side. He shouts out for Faile, hoping that she is still alive, and hearing this, the Myrddraal taunts him. \"Faile? Your Faile - was delicious.\" Perrin attacks with renewed frenzy, but slips in the mud.\nAs the Two Rivers men start to seriously lose the battle, Ihvon suddenly appears, saying that Alanna sent him to find them. He is just in time to save Perrin's life. Perrin calls out once again to rally his men, and those who are alive make their way towards him, including Faile. Perrin is devastated when he learns that twenty-seven of his men were killed.\nFinally, they all move on. The group walks and stumbles forward, and eventually Ihvon suggests that they find a farm in which to shelter for the night. As they ride on in search of shelter, Perrin hears faint strains of music in the distance.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

When the weary and wounded men approach the camp they are greeted by the Seeker, a man named Raen. Perrin has met him before and he remembers the ritual. Most of the people in his band are surprised about that.\nIla, Raen's wife, comes to greet him as well. She wants to know if Elyas is with them but Perrin hasn't seen him in a long time. Ila notices Perrin and a lot of his men are hurt and arranges their wounds to be tended. Perrin has to be helped off his horse by Ihvon. He warns Raen that he should move to Emond's Field so he'll be safe from the Trollocs but Raen refuses. He will move his people tomorrow, traveling is safety for the Tinkers.\nPerrin is taken to the wagon Raen and Ila inhabit. They will sleep under the wagon tonight so Perrin can sleep in a bed. While Ila gets the stuff she needs to look after his wounds Perrin and Ihvon discuss the fight. Perrin feels he has failed but the Warder tells him this could happen to any commander. Ila looks at the arrow and says she is not competent to remove it. The arrow is most likely barbed. It'll have to stay in until they get to Emond's Field. Ila sends everybody out of the wagon before she makes something to stop the infection and brews a tea for the pain. Perrin refuses the last one. After that she leaves them.\nPerrin tells Faile he still feels like he has failed the men and that twenty-seven are dead now because of it. Faile tells him her father always said that a general can't mourn the dead and look after the living at the same time. He can't abandon this cause because of one setback. Aram, one of the younger Tinkers in the camp, pokes his head in to ask if Egwene is with them. He makes a comment about following Elyas and running with the wolves as well. A bad tempered Perrin sends him away saying she is learning to be an Aes Sedai. Faile wants to know what Aram meant by the comment about wolves. Perrin tells her about it. Faile seems to take it well, only saying she needs to pay more attention to what she says when he is near.\nPerrin thinks it is time for a question of his own now and asks who Faile's father is. Faile is silent for a moment but then tells him her father is Lord Davram Bashere, Marshal-General to the Queen of Saldaea among other things. She tells him something of why she ran off to join the Hunt for the Horn, the restrictions of being a nobleman's daughter were too confining for her. Perrin wants to know what she is doing with a blacksmith and she simply tells him the word is love. She is convinced her parents will accept him. Still off balance Faile manages to trick him into drinking the tea Ila made and Perrin falls asleep almost immediately."

He scouts the land towards Deven Ride and sees mainly abandoned farms. Some still show signs of habitation and a few others have been burnt. Then Perrin spots a group of ravens near the Mountains of Mist. The ground eating strides he can take in the wolf dream take him there quickly. He finds himself at the site of the Manetheren Waygate. It appears to be open again. Trollocs are still pouring into the Two Rivers.\nHe gets the feeling he is being watched and jumps out of the way just in time to avoid the arrow Slayer shot at him. Perrin pursues him and finally gets a clear shot. He waits too long to take it and Slayer leaps off again. Perrin follows him again and finds himself in the forest. Slayer talks to him but Perrin can't find him. Slayer says that Perrin's tricks killed many of the Shadowwrought but that the gate is open again. Perrin's presence in the Two Rivers is an unexpected bonus for Slayer. One that has made him decide to bring many more Trollocs. Perrin senses the danger he is in and he decides to step out of the wolf dream. He is still drugged so he has to step into another dream. One featuring Faile this time.\nWhen Perrin wakes up he wants to go to the Waygate to close it permanently this time. With that arrow still in him Faile will have nothing of it of course. When Perrin gets outside and talks to Ihvon; the Warder doesn't seem worried about the new threat. The mood in the camp is decidedly better than it was last night. The Two Rivers men tell Perrin he missed something. The Tinker women danced for them. Perrin says he's seen that dance before. Faile mutters that if he thought that interesting she will, if he is good, dance the sa'sara for him sometime.\nWhen they get ready to leave Perrin tries to convince Raen to move his people to Emond's Field again but the Tinker refuses. After the long goodbye ritual the Tinkers prefer Perrin and his band head for Emond's Field. The Aiel join them again and Gaul is upset to find out Perrin overheard the two women suggesting they play Maiden's kiss with Gaul. Perrin doesn't understand any of it and Gaul doesn't want to explain. Perrin teases Faile a little with her offer to dance the sa'sara although he still has no idea what that dance is. Must be something to top the Tinker's tiganza though.\nWhen the band gets to Emond's Field he is amazed at the changes in the town. The forest is pushed back a long bowshot to make it easier to defend the town. A row of stakes has been planted all around the village and there are sentries everywhere. The Warders Tomas and Ihvon have also shown them how to build catapults. Perrin hears people whisper his new name Perrin Goldeneyes everywhere and to top it off there is a new banner rippling on a pole in the middle of the Green. A red wolf's head.\nVerin joins the group and explains they needed a symbol. The Aes Sedai no longer keep their identity secret. Faile notes this new banner could lead to trouble with Andor. The Two Rivers is still a part of that nation as far as the Queen is concerned. Verin looks at Perrin's wound and says it is beyond her Talent for Healing.

After a bit of evading the question she tells him Gaul and Loial were seen leaving Emond's Field at dawn. Perrin suspects Loial wants to close the Waygate. He still thinks it is his responsibility so he wants to get up to get them back. They can't be far yet.\nPerrin gets up, dresses and tries to make his way downstairs.

Faile gives up and lets Perrin get his horse under the condition he will not go after Gaul and Loial and that he will stay well back of any fighting. Perrin has to admit he is in no condition to fight so he agrees.\nWhen he gets to the site of the commotion it appears a lone Trolloc bothered some of the men working on clearing trees around Emond's Field. No one was seriously hurt and Verin and Alanna quickly Heal the men. Chiad and Bain make their way through the crowd to report a party of perhaps five hundred Trollocs is a mile or two behind them. Perrin asks Tomas and Ihvon why they haven't cleared the people away yet. The Warders respond Two Rivers people don't listen too well to outsiders.

When the Tinkers approach some of the Two Rivers people object. Tinkers steal, and not just things, children too as Daise Congar puts it. Perrin will have none of that and asks them if they want to leave those people to the Trollocs. Properly ashamed of themselves the Two Rivers people let the Tinkers in.

Again more people bother him with things they should know perfectly well how to take care of until Mistress al'Vere chases them out.\nFaile comes out of the kitchen where she has been helping Marin.

He has a right to defend himself after all. It hurts Perrin more than he wants to admit.\nBran walks in and tells Perrin the Whitecloaks are approaching. Perrin suspects it is to arrest him. They are lead by Dain Bornhald. Perrin thinks he is the son of Geofram who died at Falme. He recognizes Byar as well. Bornhald wants to know why Emond's Field is closed to the Whitecloaks. Bran says Emond's Field is not closed to them but that they have decided to defend themselves. Quite effectively as the burning pile of Trolloc bodies shows. Bornhald is not impressed. He tells them Taren Ferry was destroyed last night. Luc wants to know if a man named Ordeith was in Taren Ferry. Perrin didn't know they knew each other. Bornhald evades the subject. He demands Perrin be turned over to him for a trial in Amador. The situation is turning violent fast. The Whitecloaks don't have a chance of getting to him but Perrin doesn't want to see anybody hurt. He proposes a deal. They help defend Emond's Field and Bornhald and Perrin will settle their differences after the Trolloc threat is destroyed. After all, the Whitecloaks may not make it back to their camp if they try to leave now.\nBran states his conditions for this deal. He wants no arrests without approval of the Village Council, no entering a house without being invited, the Whitecloaks will help defend Emond's Field how and where he tells them to and there will be no Dragon's Fang scribbled on doors. Bornhald realizes he doesn't have much of a choice. He agrees to Bran's terms. Until the Trollocs have been destroyed. Faile is not convinced Perrin should have made the deal but Perrin tells her he had no choice. He won't allow people to do the Trollocs' work for them."

She is disgusted that \"order had broken down enough for penniless refugees to take over the circles\", even though this means that Tarabon will be more easily taken by the Corenne. Egeanin doesn't stand out in the crowd because she left her guards and chair behind so that she could follow Gelb without him noticing. Gelb has brought several thugs with him, \"burly rough-faced men all\", and she knows that he will try to kidnap someone. Gelb has already kidnapped three women who vaguely matched the description she gave him and Egeanin realises that \"she should never have paid him for that first woman.\" She is distracted suddenly by shouts that surround a man with a broken arm; the person who broke his arm has already melted into the crowd.\nEgeanin loses track of Gelb for a moment but she spots him and his companions again. From their stances she can tell that they are about to kidnap someone. She notices two women walking down the street who, although dressed like Taraboners, \"were out of place here\". The blonde is dismissed but the brunette \"looked very much like a sul'dam named Surine\" except that she is too short.

Nynaeve disagrees, \"feet are for walking\", and claims that she feels safer walking than being carried by men she doesn't trust. Elayne thinks that \"twenty bodyguards would have suited her well\", especially since she has had three of her purses stolen already. She tells Nynaeve that it would have been better if they had worn plainer dresses and thinks to herself that Nynaeve \"had come to enjoy wearing silks and pretty dresses\".\nThe night before, Elayne had met with Egwene and Amys in Tel'aran'rhiod and Amys gave her a lecture about the danger of it. She told Elayne that she should control what she though in Tel'aran'rhiod, something that Elayne thinks is very difficult. Interrupting them, a man rushes at Elayne and she swings her barrel stave at him and breaks his nose. More men attack them- one yelling, \"Don't let her get away. She's gold, I tell you\"- and Elayne thinks that they are trying to abduct her because she is the Daughter Heir of Andor. Both Nynaeve and Elayne embrace saidar though they don't use it in case the Black Ajah are close by. Suddenly, a woman comes to their rescue, Egeanin though they don't know it yet, and together they manage to stop the thugs and send them on their way. The last man tries to attack Egeanin but Elayne channels at him, sending \"the man and his knife into a back flip\".\nNynaeve invites Egeanin back to their inn for tea and she accepts, even though she is hesitant because she saw Elayne channel. Juilin is in their room and tells them, cautiously because of Egeanin, that he has found the house that the Black Ajah has used. However, \"little remains now except a few scraps of food\" because from what he has heard, they left last night. Nynaeve is angry because she thinks that Juilin was careless and tells him that they will talk later. Rendra comes in and serves them tea, chattering all the while about frivolous things, \"Your dresses, they are magnificent. Beautiful\". Egeanin is amazed that they allow Rendra to talk \"as if you were her sisters\" and Juilin to mock them.\nEgeanin offers to help them gain information about \"these women the dark man spoke of\" in return for them telling her more of the White Tower. Elayne and Nynaeve refuse to let her help but agree to answer more questions about Aes Sedai. Egeanin is extremely surprised that channeling can be learnt but before Elayne can ask her something, Thom walks in. He tells them that \"Lady Amathera is to be invested as Panarch\" but rumour has it that the Assembly had refused her. He says that there are bound to be riots. Bayle Domon is to provide fifty bodyguards for Elayne and Nynaeve to ensure their safety in the days ahead. Thom leaves before Nynaeve can berate him for hiring bodyguards and Egeanin leaves soon after.\nElayne and Nynaeve talk about the bodyguards, \"You do agree they're necessary\", and Nynaeve thinks that Egeanin knows Domon Bayle, \"She was startled. She knows him\". Rendra knocks again and says that someone is asking for them in the inn, \"She says that she believes she knows you\". Elayne and Nynaeve think that she is Black Ajah and invite her in, quickly forming weaves of Air and a Shield. The woman walks in and embraces saidar and does something to both the women. We later learn that she is Moghedien and the weave is Compulsion.\nShe talks to Elayne and Nynaeve and they find themselves hurrying to obey her, \"anything to please this woman\". They tell her that there are no Aes Sedai with them and everything that they have learnt about the Black Ajah. However, Moghedien's haste means that she misses some vital information; she does not know that Elayne has the twisted ring ter'angreal and that they are not actually Aes Sedai. From what they tell her, Moghedien learns that Be'lal is dead and she believes the body in Tear was Ishamael's. She has learnt of \"something to control a man who can channel\". She instructs Elayne and Nynaeve to forget their meeting and what they have told her and leaves. They are slightly confused and start to talk about the Black Ajah again."

She notices that Danelle, a \"young Brown sister\", has appeared not to notice the too large numbers of builders that had been hired to rebuild part of the library; they \"could rebuild the entire library with that many men\". Siuan is frustrated that she can't concentrate because she has had one message from Moiraine, \"The sling has been used. The shepherd holds the sword\", and nothing since. Once the Hall had learnt that someone had taken Callandor, \"they voted unanimously and with no need for arm twisting\" that the White Tower should try to guide him.\nShe keeps the message in a warded box along with other messages. One says that the novice who brought Min to see Siuan is missing; she was actually killed by an unknown channeler. There is a man in Ghealdan who is preaching the glories of the Dragon Reborn; he is Masema, the Shienaran soldier who travelled with Rand in \"The Great Hunt\". Mazrim Taim has not been found, tension between Arad Doman and Tarabon is rising once more and ships have gone missing in the Aryth Ocean. Two Aes Sedai are missing in Illian and one in Caemlyn while a lot of her Eyes and Ears are silent.\nSuddenly, the door to her study opens and \"more than a dozen women strode into her study\". They are led by Elaida and include several Reds, Danelle of the Brown Ajah, Joline of the Green Ajah, Shemerin of the Yellow Ajah, Alviarin of the White Ajah. From later chapters we know that Teslyn of the Red Ajah, Evanellein of the Gray Ajah, Javindhra of the Red Ajah and Andaya of the Gray Ajah were also present. Only the Blue Ajah is not represented.\nSiuan orders Elaida to leave \"before I make you wish that you were an ignorant novice again\", but she stays and Elaida takes the striped stole from Siuan's shoulders, \"You were never fit for it\". Without her noticing, Siuan has been Shielded and Elaida weaves flows of Air to bind her, \"crushing her arms to her side\". Alviarin looks through the papers on Siuan's desk and tries to open the warded box but it \"flared in a ball of flame\", she had not noticed the delicate ward. Elaida tells Siuan that the Hall met earlier- not all the sisters met but \"enough Sitters to meet our laws\" were present- and they voted to remove Siuan from the position as Amyrlin Seat.\nSiuan says that the full Hall will meet and the vote will be reversed. \"There has never been a rebellion inside the Tower\" but everyone will know the fate of the rebels. Some of Elaida's supporters are doubtful, she doesn't \"have as tight a grip on her conspirators as she thought\". Elaida orders that Siuan is to be taken away and as she goes through the antechamber she sees that Leane is also Shielded and bound but more importantly, her Warder Alric is dying of a knife wound. Elaida is impatient to know what else Siuan has been hiding from her, \"you are going to tell me every last scrap\"."

She is angry because she thinks that he is \"caressing eyes with this milk-skinned wench\", Isendre, even though he is not. She believes that he belongs to Elayne and is contemptuous of Isendre because \"she is soft...weak\". He sees that Isendre is watching him again from one of the wagons and that Kadere does not seem to mind. Rand also notices that Keille and Natael are arguing again and that \"sometimes they looked at Rand\" before quickly looking away again. He has gotten used to this treatment because everybody, including the Shaido, \"wanted to know what he was going to do\".\nRand asks Aviendha to talk to him about Aiel customs again. When she first started walking with him she would not talk to him but a talk with the Wise Ones made her demand \"that he let her teach him about Aiel ways and customs\". Her lectures are often enjoyable, even though she tends to fly into a rage sometimes, and Rand has learnt a lot about the Aiel Waste. Aviendha has taught him which plants are edible and which are not followed by which plants indicate that water is to be found near. She has talked about the poisonous animals that live in the Waste including the gara, a brown and yellow lizard, and the two-step, a small brown snake. Rand still doesn't understand about the Aiel roofmistresses and the holds. Aviendha tries to explain that \"a man cannot own a roof any more than he can own land\"; it is the women in Aiel society who own the land. A woman is built a roof by her family before she marries and it is her roof and not her husband's when they marry. A man must ask permission from his new wife to enter her roof.\nMoiraine spends most of her time with the Wise Ones but she sometimes rides with Rand to try to find out what he is up to. Rand refuses to tell her and this makes her angry, something that causes Aviendha to mutter \"It is stupid to anger Aes Sedai... I did not think you were a stupid man\". Egwene doesn't leave the company of the Wise Ones even though they believe that she is full Aes Sedai. In fact they seem to treat her as they do Aviendha, \"though her (Aviendha) they seemed to bully rather than argue with\". Rand notices that the Wise Ones don't force Egwene to dress like a little girl although he hadn't realized the meaning behind the clothes.\nDuring the journey Kadere talks to Rand several times. He hints that he has valuable knowledge to sell but Rand is uneasy because Kadere wants amnesty to crimes he has committed in the past. He rebuffs Kadere's deal because \"there's always a question of price... some prices I might not want to pay\". Natael, the gleeman, also talks to Rand during the journey, claiming that he wants to write \"a grand epic to tell your tale\". He tells Rand that he \"would not take your place for all the world, not with the fate that accompanies it\". Natael asks rather morbid questions about madness and death and when Rand refuses to answer, Natael stops coming to see him. He instead spends most of his time with the Shaido, much to Rhuarc's annoyance but nothing can be done to stop him.\nOn the other hand Aviendha spends a lot time with the Wise Ones. Rand thinks that they simply want to know what information she has gained from him but soon realises that they are teaching her to channel. Rand would have enjoyed Mat's company during the journey but Mat seems uncomfortable around Rand. He refuses to talk about Rhuidean but sometimes lets slip about what happened there. Instead he spends most of his time in wagons dicing with the drivers and pursuing Isendre. Seeing Mat's interest in Isendre, Keille offers to sell her for a gold mark, \"a chit like that cannot be worth more than two\", but Isendre storms off in anger. Keille finds it funny that Mat has refused an offer from her twice and warns that she might have to do something about it.\nOn the twelfth day Rhuarc announces that they are at Cold Rocks Hold, the hold of the roofmistress Lian.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

              "pov_summary": "After Rhuarc announces that they have arrived at Cold Rocks Hold Rand looks around, puzzled because he cannot see the hold, \"it could have been any piece of the Waste\". Rhuarc begins to run towards what Rand thinks is a wall and the other Jindo follow him while the Shaido set up camp. Rand asks Aviendha to ride behind him so that she can give him advice about the Aiel customs; she agrees but warns him not to \"make me look the fool before my sisters\". Rand heels Jeade'en into a canter so that he can catch up with Rhuarc while Aviendha tells him that he must remove his shoufa, \"you must enter a hold with your face clear to be seen\". It is also customary to make noise when approaching a hold to show that you do not mean to take it by surprise. When Rand draws level with Rhuarc he notices that Amys and Couladin have joined him. He is puzzled when he notices that Couladin is looking at him with amusement, \"hate and disdain Rand had come to expect, but amusement?\"\nMat rides up to them and wants to know what is happening and Rand explains where they are. Mat says comments that the hold \"isn't a patch on the Stone, or the Tora Harad\"; the Tora Harad is something from his memories. He goes on to wonder whether Keille and Kadere will leave soon and Rand replies that \"there's a sort of fair whenever clan chiefs meet\" and that the merchants will not want to miss it.\nRand gets his first glimpse of the hold and is very surprised by what he sees. The canyon walls are covered with greenery, unlike the rest of the Waste, and the canyon is filled with \"small flat-roofed houses of grey stone or yellow clay\". The roofs of the house have been converted into gardens growing fruits and vegetables and there are paths winding between the houses. These paths are now lined with women, men and children who are beating pots to welcome the Jindo back. Amys runs into the hold ahead of Rhuarc and the others who have slowed to a fast walk.\nRand notices that Amys has climbed on to a platform at the far end of the hold and is standing with another Aiel woman and realizes that she is \"Lian, roofmistress of Cold Rocks Hold\". Rhuarc steps forward and asks as a clan chief to enter the hold, \"I ask leave to enter your hold\", and Lian welcomes him warmly. Heirn then asks as sept chief, \"I ask leave to come beneath your roof\", and is also welcomed. Couladin then steps forwards and asks as a clan chief to enter the hold. Aviendha cannot believe that he has asked as a clan chief when he is not one and tells Rand that it is within Lian's power to refuse him \"and she may, for such an insult\". Finally Lian gives her answer and says, \"You have my leave... to step beneath my roof. Water and shade will be found for you\". Aviendha tells Rand that \"she has welcomed him as a beggar\" and then pushes Rand forwards.\nAs Car'a'carn Rand should ask to enter as would a clan chief but he instead asks as a sept chief. Amys has told Lian that Rand is He Who Comes With the Dawn and she welcomes him into the hold, \"For the chief of chiefs, there is ever water and shade at Cold Rocks Hold\". Couladin glares at Rand before stalking back to the Shaido camp and Mat warns Rand to \"watch you back with that one\". Rand thinks that Couladin is not his real threat and that Lanfear and Moiraine are.\nAmys and Lian climb down from the platform and Rhuarc introduces them both as his wives; both Rand and Mat are shocked at this. Rhuarc is surprised that Rand did not know about the Aiel custom because he thought that Aviendha, as his teacher, should have told him. Aviendha insists that \"there were more important matters\" and Rand quickly adds that \"she has been a very good teacher\" and that he wants her to continue teaching him. Amys considers this and agrees that Aviendha should continue to teach him about Aiel customs, though Aviendha seems less than happy at this arrangement.\nLian invites Rand and Mat to \"come beneath my roof\" for the evening and they walk to her house. Rand notices that it only looks large enough for two rooms but when he steps inside he realizes that other rooms have been created by cutting into the canyon walls. The floors are covered by rugs and carpets in styles from countries such as Tear, Illian and Andor. He notices that many of the objects come from outside of the Aiel Waste and though \"it could have had the garishness of Tear\", it instead looks very grand. Rand gives Lian a gold lion and Mat gives her a Tairen necklace as guest gifts. By this time the Wise Ones, Moiraine, Egwene and Lan have also arrived but Lian refuses a guest gift from Moiraine, \"your very presence is guest gift beyond value\". Moiraine comments that more Aes Sedai will visit the Waste soon but the Wise Ones do not look happy about that.\nGai'shain bring in drinks and food for the evening meal and the group begin to eat. Aiel do not sit at a table to eat, they lie on the floor with their \"heads together, cushions under their chests, radiating out like spokes in a wheel\" and so this is what the group do. Aviendha spends the meal lecturing Rand \"in tooth-grinding detail\" about more Aiel customs, though it is Amys and Lian who tell him about sister-wives. Aviendha seems angry and Rand tells her that she can refuse to be his teacher, \"I'm sure Rhuarc or the Wise Ones will find someone else\". She refuses and carries on lecturing him about the Aiel customs.\nAfter the meal is finished Rhuarc gives Rand some news about the other clans. The Goshien and Shaarad clans are already at Alcair Dal and the Chareen are on their way. Rand knows that \"something like the Peace of Rhuidean holds at Alcair Dal\" but is worried that the Goshien and Shaarad clans might start fighting because they have a feud. Melaine and Bain are emphatic that the clans will not fight at Alcair Dal and Rhuarc explains that he cannot travel to Alcair Dal to make sure that the peace holds. Any clans who arrive after Rand arrives will have lost ji and Rand cannot afford to do that. To be safe, Rand must wait a month before going to Alcair Dal and although Rand is concerned that he cannot wait a month he knows that he has no choice.\nRhuarc goes on to explain who will probably side with Rand. He believes that the Taardad, Reyn and Nakai clans will almost certainly join him while the Tomanelle clan \"may move in any direction\" and the Shaido may not support him. However he believes that most clans will join him, if not all, because the two dragons prove that he is the Car'a'carn. He thinks that Rand should wear the cadin'sor to show that he has Aiel parentage but Rand refuses, \"I will not pretend. I am what I am\". Moiraine asks where he means to \"lead the spears once more\" but Rand doesn't answer. Instead he announces that he is going to walk outside and leaves the house."

All men wear the cadin'sor although there are slight differences between the warriors and the craftsmen; for example, \"a smaller belt knife or none at all\". Young boys wear robes like the gai'shain except they are the brown/grey or the cadin'sor. Young girls wear their hair in plaits like Egwene used to except Rand doesn't realise that she wore them as punishment. He notices that the peddlers are selling many of their goods to the Aiel. To his surprise Rand notices that Natael is down with the wagons rather than with the Shaido but thinks that \"maybe Keille just did not want him out of her sight\".\nRand discovers that the Jindo have gone to \"the roof of his or her society here at Cold Rocks Hold\" and that the Roof of the [Maidens] is half way up the east side of the canyon. The Maidens guarding the Roof refuse to let him enter but carry a message to the Jindo and Nine Valleys Maidens from him instead. Rand knows that the Aiel have a love of ceremony and that gifts are often given as a thank you. He believes that if he gives Aviendha a gift in return for her teaching then perhaps she will not hate him as much as she seems to now. The Maidens come out of their roof, Rand is not permitted to enter, and show him several gifts that he could give to Aviendha; he finally decides on \"a wide bracelet of ivory heavily carved with roses\" presented to him by Adelin, a Jindo Maiden. Adelin will not let him pay for the bracelet and assures him that \"it will not dishonour her\". A ceremony is then performed where Rand and Adelin take a sip of tea and utter \"Remember honour\"; it is then repeated for every Jindo and Nine Valleys Maiden present.\nRand finds Aviendha beating carpets outside Lian's house and gives her the bracelet as \"a gift in return for her teaching\". Aviendha doesn't appear to want the gift and Rand thinks that she believes that it will harm her honour so he tells her that Adelin and the Maidens approved. Aviendha tells him that the Maidens have \"approved of you, as if I stilled carried the spear\" because they think that he is courting her. Rand cannot return the gift and reject the ceremony because that would harm her honour; they must let the Maidens believe what they already believe. Aviendha then apologises to him for being angry during the meal though Rand thinks that Amys told her to apologise.\nRand leaves Aviendha to her carpet beating and enters Lian's house to find that the Wise Ones are waiting for him. He asks Amys if she asked Aviendha to apologise to Rand but she denies it, \"a forced apology is no apology\". He then tells them that he knows that they use Aviendha to spy on him but they tell him that he \"does not know as much as you think\". Rand admits that he keeps Aviendha with him because \"at least this way I know who the spy is\" but tells them that he will not tell Aviendha what he intends to do. Melaine is angry because she feels that he is just using the Aiel. She tells him that she intends to \"make you know our blood for yours if I have to lay the-\" but she is cut off by Amys before she can say what she intends to lay for Rand. When Rand thinks about it later he thinks that Melaine means to lay a trap but some readers believe that she meant that she would lay a bridal wreath at his feet. Amys summons a gai'shain to lead Rand to his room and leaves them to go to bed.\nRand drifts off to sleep and dreams that he is swimming in the Waterwood. Elayne and Min are also swimming there but Rand tells himself that \"he could not love both of them\". He sees Aviendha on the bank and she tells him that \"You do not know who you love\" but he is distracted when he hears laughter from the opposite bank. Lanfear stands there and asks if she should \"allow you to be unfaithful to me, even in your dreams\". Rand does not recognise her and when she tries to kiss him, he pushes her away. Lanfear then bites him because she wants to mark him as hers but suddenly slips away from Rand when she hears another man's voice. Rand cannot see the man, only a blur the rough size and shape of a man; the man berates Lanfear for risking their plan but Lanfear sneers that \"you fear risk as much as Moghedien\". The man says that he is tired of pulling strings on a puppet and Lanfear is angry because she thinks that the man is betraying her. The blur disappears and then so does Lanfear; shortly after Rand wakes up.\nRand realises that he is not alone in the room and channels the lights on and binds the intruder in flows of Air, only to find that it is Aviendha. He releases her and she stands up, wary because \"I do not believe I will ever become used to\" a man channeling. Rand is angry at her because he could easily have mistaken her for an assailant and killed her. Aviendha lets slip that the Wise Ones had meant to watch him from his dreams; Aviendha was not allowed to help them because \"Seana said it was too dangerous tonight\". She doesn't really know why she is in his room, \"I could not protect you very well\", but she is cut off by Rand when he realises that \"there was a feel in the air, a sense of wrongness\".\nRand channels a sword into existence and motions for Aviendha to follow him \"as he padded from the room\". He moves through the silent house and spots one of the gai'shain with a man. Rand thinks that Chion is kissing the man but when the man turns round he sees that it is a Draghkar. The Draghkar tries to ensnare him with its song but the Void dispels its hypnotic effects allowing Rand to kill it. Aviendha checks Chion for signs of life but quickly realises that she is dead. She has to throw herself to the floor when \"a bar of solid fire shot over her from his blade to strike the chest of the Draghkar just filling the outer doorway\". Rand orders Aviendha to wake the hold while he strikes the gong, the signal that the hold is under attack.\nLeaving the warmth of the house, Rand sees Seana's body lying on the path, \"she had had no chance against a Draghkar\". When Rand strikes the gong, chaos erupts in the hold as the Aiel prepare to fight. He can hear the howls of Trollocs as he kills another Draghkar with the One Power. Rand is joined by Rhuarc who offers him a shoufa but Rand refuses to wear it because \"they hunt for me... they can't find me if they\u200b do not know where I am\"; Rand runs towards the battle."

He looks around the canyon and sees that Moiraine is Healing the wounded and that more Aiel are coming out of their houses to help. A Maiden tells him that \"you dance the spear well\" and comments that the Trollocs might have reached the hold had Moiraine not been there. Mat points out that \"there weren't enough for that\" but regrets it when the Maiden asks if he is \"a battle leader among the Wetlanders\".\nMat walks over to the peddlers' wagons and sees Isendre; he tells her that the Trollocs have been killed only to have her slam the door of the wagon is his face. Angry he turns towards the hold and sees Rand walking up towards him with Aviendha following him. Moiraine hurries up to them and tells Rand that \"the Draghkar were surely aimed at you\" only to be told that he already knows that. She warns him that \"prophesy is most dangerous when you try to make it happen\" and asks him to confide in her. Rand agrees to confide in her if she promises to stop manipulating him but Moiraine promises that she \"will do nothing to hinder you fulfilling your destiny\". This isn't enough for Rand so he refuses to tell her anything of his plans.\nRhuarc walks up to the group and tells Rand that the Trollocs were only a diversion for the Draghkar and that he expects the Gray Man to attack soon. He tells Rand that he should be protected at all times and that \"the Maidens have volunteered for this task\". Rhuarc also tells Rand that all of the Aiel will be on their guard in case the next attackers are \"ten thousand Trollocs instead of a few hundred\". Mat asks if the Shaido camp will be safe and Rhuarc replies that they needn't worry about the Shaido, \"Couladin and the Shaido folded their tents at nightfall\". He believes that they will have gone to join Sevanna and the other Shaido who are on their way to Alcair Dal. Sevanna acts as a clan chief because Suladric is dead but she will most likely follow Couladin since she only married Suladric because \"she meant to wed a clan chief\".\nRand decides that they must leave for Alcair Dal \"when first light hits the sky\" because he doesn't want Couladin to turn the Aiel against him. Rhuarc thinks that he should only take a handful of Maidens with him as custom demands but Rand insists that he will leave \"with every hand that can carry a spear or draw a bow\". Rhuarc is shocked but Rand maintains that \"I have to make new customs\". Mat agrees to go to Alcair Dal with Rand but only because he can feel the pull of ta'veren.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

As they dine, they speak of the war between Arad Doman and Tarabon; when Rendra enters the room, she joins in the conversation.\nElayne thinks of Egeanin and how she and Nynaeve are spending so much time with her. Not realizing who Egeanin is, they both like her very much. At the moment, Egeanin is questioning Elayne and Nynaeve about Aes Sedai in an attempt to learn why the a'dam is able to collar a sul'dam as well as a damane. Egeanin then tells both of the others that she knows they are looking for someone. \"You have not made any real effort to keep secret from me that you are looking for someone.\" She is just about to start questioning them about it when Bayle Domon walks into the room.\nHe begins to say that he has found the Black Ajah when he sees Egeanin. \"You!\" he shouts. Upon seeing him, Egeanin jumps up from her chair and tries to punch Domon in the stomach, but he catches her wrist and they fight. Domon comes out victorious, pinning her to the floor with a boot on her shoulder. Elayne, not knowing what to think, weaves Air around the both of them. \"What is the meaning of this?\" At the same time, Nynaeve demands that Domon release Egeanin, and he reveals that she is Seanchan. At first, Elayne and Nynaeve do not know whether to believe him, but when Egeanin does not deny it they begin to realize that it is the truth.\nNynaeve begins to rant at Egeanin. \"Seanchan! Worming your way into our friendship!\" and \"Did you mean to lure us somewhere your filthy sul'dam could lock their leashes about our throats?\" Egeanin seems surprised that she knows about damane, and Nynaeve tells her that sul'dam can channel too. \"For every woman who can channel that you've leashed like an animal, you walk by another ten or twenty every day without realizing it.\" Egeanin responds, telling them that she knows this, and that she has been searching for information to explain why it works that way.\nNynaeve and Elayne are still shocked at the news that Egeanin is Seanchan, and they start questioning her. She tells them that she had captured a sul'dam with an a'dam, and when Nynaeve's fists tighten, informs them that she set Bethamin free the night before. Elayne and Nynaeve do not know what to do with her; Elayne tells Nynaeve that she does not believe Egeanin is a Darkfriend, and their prisoner responds vehemently that she certainly isn't.\nNext, Domon tells them what he found out about the Black Ajah. He found two of the women at the Panarch's Palace, but Nynaeve is speculative. They talk shortly about why they would be in the Panarch's Palace, with all the Whitecloaks around, and then Juilin enters the room. He asks if he can speak to Nynaeve alone, but she responds that he can very well say anything he needs to say right there, and then asks if he has \"found them in the Panarch's Palace, too?\"\nThom is the next to enter, and he also asks if he can speak with Nynaeve alone, saying that he has important news. Nynaeve tells Thom that she does not have time, as they have just found out that the Black sisters are in the Panarch's Palace. Thom is shocked, as this is the news that he wanted to relay to Nynaeve. Elayne asks Thom is he has any information on whether Amathera could be a Darkfriend, but he has no clue. He then asks why Egeanin is there, as she was not supposed to know about all of this, and he is told that she is Seanchan; Juilin had not yet heard either, and both of them are as shocked as Elayne and Nynaeve were.\nThey all sit down to talk, and narrow the Amathera problem down to three possibilities: 1) Amathera is a Darkfriend, 2) She thinks that the Black sisters are normal Aes Sedai, or 3) She is their prisoner. The discussion goes on throughout the whole meal and longer.\nEventually, the three men went out so they can try to find more information, leaving the three women alone. They wait, and the men come back every so often to update them: so far, they have no new information. Eventually, they are all back in the room some three hours after sunset. Bayle Domon is dispirited and says that it will just be another Falme, and that if they don't find something within the next couple of days, he will be leaving. Thom is exhausted and just wants to sleep, but Juilin says that he will go out and search some more. Nynaeve tells him that he will do nothing of the such, and that all three men will be taking turns guarding the door to her and Elayne's room.\nEgeanin spends the night on a pallet in the room with Elayne and Nynaeve. Nynaeve insists on binding her hands behind her back. She then demands that Elayne give her the stone ring ter'angreal, telling the younger woman to wake her up in an hour. After Nynaeve is asleep, Elayne and Egeanin talk a little bit. Egeanin says that she is terrified, and Elayne tells her that no matter how much Nynaeve hates her, that they won't harm her.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

She is still pondering the situation with Egeanin, though her thoughts eventually shift to wondering where Egwene is. She can't help but think that anything could jump out at her while she is waiting, and when Egwene, Amys and Bair arrive, it is to find Nynaeve dressed in armor. Nynaeve, embarrassed, quickly changes back into Two Rivers garments.\nEgwene tells Nynaeve about the Trolloc and Draghkar attack on Cold Rocks Hold, and then goes on to say that Moiraine is frustrated because Rand will not tell her his plans. She also mentions that she is worried about Rand. \"I don't know whether it is madness or design. I could almost bear it either way if I knew. Nynaeve, I'll admit it isn't prophecy, or Tarmon Gai'don, that make me anxious right now. Maybe it is foolish, but I promised Elayne to look after him, and I do not know how.\"\nNynaeve follows up by relating to Egwene what has been happening in Tanchico, and that they still don't know what they are looking for. She asks if there is any way for her to get into Amathera's dreams in order to find out if she is a Darkfriend or not, and Bair tells her that she is foolish. When Nynaeve snaps at the Wise One, she finds her hair split into two braids with red ribbons, and that she is wearing a short skirt and loose white blouse, which is what young girls wear among the Aiel. She struggles, but eventually manages to regain her normal clothing.\nNynaeve is seemingly desperate to get help in finding out what she and Elayne should be looking for. \"If there is anything you can do to help, anything you can tell me...anything at all.\" The Wise Ones tell her about a technique that centers on Need. They tell her that if she concentrates on what she needs - a way to keep the Black Ajah from finding a device that can control Rand - that \"concentrating on that need will bring you near to what you want. Concentrating on the need again will bring you closer. Each step brings you nearer, until at last you are not only in the valley, but standing beside where water is to be found.\" Egwene and Nynaeve then make plans to meet again in seven days, and Egwene and the Wise Ones leave.\nTo start off with, Nynaeve concentrates on the city of Tanchico, and then on the Panarch's Palace, and on what she needs to find. She finds herself in a bedchamber located in the Panarch's Palace. In the bedchamber, she finds Amathera and Temaile; Temaile is forcing the Panarch to sing bawdy songs. Nynaeve shifts to another place, and finds herself in the Panarch's museum. There, she finds a woman whom she does not know wandering about. Thinking that it could be a Black sister she does not know about, Nynaeve is about to embrace the source when she spies Birgitte. She is distracted, and the woman disappears. The Hero tells Nynaeve that it was Moghedien whom she had seen. They stand there talking about numerous things: the Wheel, Falme, and why Birgitte is speaking to Nynaeve when she should not be. It is thus that Gaidal Cain finds them and reprimands Birgitte for speaking with Nynaeve. They argue shortly, and Gaidal ends up completely ignoring Nynaeve.\nNynaeve proceeds to question Birgitte on what she knows of Moghedien, and Birgitte tells her of the promise that Moghedien once made to her: \"She promised to make me weep alone for as long as the Wheel turns. She said it as a fact that simply had not happened.\"\nNynaeve goes to try to find Moghedien. She makes her way over to a glass case that Moghedien had been smiling at, and sees, among other things, one of the seals on the Dark One's prison. She shifts again, and this time, she finds a necklace and two bracelets of jointed black metal that radiate pain, sorrow and suffering. She instantly knows that this is what the Black Ajah has been hunting for. But before she can investigate further, Elayne awakens her."

They find that Thom has been attacked and that Juilin and Bayle Domon are standing over an unconscious man with pale yellow hair.

The Woman's Circle is sitting around a table, going over lists of supplies, while the Village Council is talking about battle. While the men are talking about weapons, Perrin hears the women say that they can't let the men know that they are living on half-rations, since the men need to keep up their strength.\nDannil Lewin enters with a message for Perrin; \"The Whitecloaks have brought in a man who wants to talk to you, Perrin. He won't talk to anybody else. He's hurt bad, Perrin. They brought him to the edge of the village.\" Perrin, Faile and Aram all leave the inn to speak with the messenger. They find the man surrounded by villagers and farmers, with an arrow stuck in his chest. Upon learning that Perrin Goldeneyes has arrived, the man begins to speak. \"We are - coming. Sent to - tell you. We are co-\" before he can finish his last sentence, the man dies. Perrin thinks that maybe he means a family is making their way towards Emond's Field for protection.\nJust as Faile is trying to convince Perrin to get some sleep, a young boy runs up to tell Perrin that something is moving in the Westwood. They soon learn that it is Loial, running towards the village carrying Gaul. Loial tells Perrin that they have done it, that they have closed the Waygate and that it will take the Elders or an Aes Sedai to open it now. Neither of them are hurt badly, though Gaul is limping; Chiad and Bain tend to him.\nLoial and Gaul tell Perrin that there are possibly two thousand Trollocs in the Two Rivers area, despite the fact that the Waygate has now been closed. However, Luc rides up and says that it is more likely less than a thousand. He then presents Perrin with a 'trophy,' the head of a Myrddraal. When he leaves, Loial and Gaul still insist that the number of Trollocs is higher than what Luc thinks.\nPerrin tells Loial and Gaul to get some sleep. \"I am afraid your bedroom has half a dozen Tinkers in it now, but Mistress al'Vere will make you up a pallet. It is time for you to get some of that sleep you want.\" Upon hearing this, Faile once again starts trying to convince Perrin that he needs sleep as well. Looking at her, Perrin thinks of how beautiful she is, and agrees.\nWhen he falls asleep, he finds himself in the Wolf Dream. As he looks around, a patch of the sky darkens and he finds himself looking through a window to somewhere else. \"Egwene stood among a crowd of women, fear in her eyes; slowly the women knelt around her. Nynaeve was one of them, and he believed he saw Elayne's red-gold hair.\" Next, he sees another scene. \"Mat stood naked and bound, snarling; an odd spear with a black shaft had been thrust across his back behind his elbows, and a silver medallion, a foxhead, hung on his chest.\" The 'window' shifts again, and this time he is looking at Rand. \"He wore rags and a rough cloak, and a bandage covered his eyes.\"\nAfter the 'window' closes, Perrin finds himself wearing a blacksmith's long leather vest and no shirt, with his hammer at his side. He concentrates on the axe, thinking that he is no longer a blacksmith who needs a hammer. Slowly, the hammer changes into the axe. A quiver filled with arrows appears on his other hip, and he finds a longbow in his hand. He starts to run, taking the long, land-blurring strides that are possible in the Wolf Dream. He finds himself three miles from the village, where the nearest Trolloc camp supposedly is. He finds burned wood, and great black iron cauldrons that stand ready\u200b to be hung over cook fires. Next, he circles the land around Emond's Field and finds more clusters of cook pots. As the numbers add up, he realizes that there are indeed two thousand - likely more - Trollocs in the surrounding area.\nHe keeps moving, passing burned farms, and the destroyed Tuatha'an caravan. He eventually arrives at Deven Ride, where he finds only about half a dozen Trolloc camps. Next, he moves on to Watch Hill, and finds that there are only a few camps here as well. When he arrives at Taren Ferry, all he sees is a burned village and no Trolloc camps.\nAs Perrin ponders over what is happening, Slayer tries to kill him with an arrow. It misses Perrin as he bends down to pick up a doll with a painted wooden face. Perrin nocks an arrow and waits. He spots a hint of movement, and Perrin sees Slayer's face; he thinks of how it looks so much like Lan's face. Perrin continues to wait, and when Slayer slowly steps out of hiding, Perrin shoots an arrow at him. It hits him through the chest, but doesn't pierce his heart. Slayer slowly fades from the wolf-dream, and thinking that he is dead, Perrin steps out of the dream.\nWhen Perrin wakes up, he hears shouting outside and the clattering of hooves. He makes his way downstairs, and Ban al'Seen tells him that Luc had just left the village. \"It was Lord Luc, Lord Perrin. He nearly rode down Wil and Tell. I don't think he even saw them. He was all hunched over in his saddle like he was hurt, and spurring that stallion for all he was worth, Lord Perrin.\" Perrin ponders this, knowing that Luc had not been wounded earlier, and comes to the startling conclusion that maybe Luc and Slayer are the same person.\nWhen Perrin finds Faile, he tells her that he needs her to do something for him. He tells her that he wants her to take a message to Caemlyn, and that on the way, she can let Watch Hill know how things are going. He wants her to ask Queen Morgase to send some of the Queen's Guards, and that Bain and Chiad can keep her safe during the journey. Chiad seems anxious at this, but Faile informs her that she will not have to leave Gaul, which startles Perrin. Faile then considers what Perrin has said. \"It is a long way to Caemlyn. Weeks to ride there, plus however long it might take to reach and convince Morgase, then more weeks to return with the Queen's Guards.\"\nPerrin tells her that they can easily hold out that long, but he is lying; all he wants is to get Faile safely out of the Two Rivers. Before Perrin can say anything else to Faile, Loial approaches and asks if Faile can carry his book with her when she goes to Caemlyn, to keep it safe until he can come for it.\nAfter a long period of silence, she changes the subject, saying that he needs to trim his beard. When Perrin goes back to the Caemlyn topic, Faile agrees, but she says that he must pay a price. She tells him that if she goes to Caemlyn, that he must marry her. Perrin smiles, and says that the Woman's Circle can speak the betrothal vows before she leaves, but that according to Two River's custom the actual wedding must wait a year. However, Faile is insistent. \"I will have you for husband tonight, or I will not go until I do!\"\nPerrin argues with her, saying that he would if he could, but that Daise Congar would crack his head if he tried to go against custom. Faile then haltingly informs him that after mentioning to Mistress al'Vere and Daise Congar about the time they spent travelling together, they told her that she and Perrin can already be considered betrothed under the customs. \"The year is just to make sure you really do get on well together - which we do, as anyone can see - and here I am being as forward as some Domani hussy or one of those Tairen galls - if you even think of Berelain - oh, Light, I'm babbling, and you won't even - \"\nPerrin interrupts her by kissing her, and asks her to marry him.\nHalf an hour later, with Aram and Loial standing for Perrin and Bain and Chiad for Faile, the Woman's Circle performs their marriage."

As they ride, Elayne thinks back to the discussion that led them to this in the first place. Upon deciding that she and Nynaeve must get into the Panarch's Palace as soon as possible, Bayle Domon, Juilin and Thom all began to insist that they must be able to go along as well to protect the women. Nynaeve eventually put an end to this: \"You all know what you have to do, and you cannot do it trying to watch over us like a pair of geese for market!\" Egeanin then offered to accompany them, and after a bit of arguing on Nynaeve's part, it was agreed.\nElayne is jostled out of her reverie when Whitecloaks stop the cart to question Domon. As they are waiting to move on, someone begins shouting that the Panarch is dead. It seems that this is part of some sort of a plan to start a riot, as Elayne thinks that \"Thom and Juilin had made a good job of seeding their rumors during the night.\" Eventually, the cart begins to move again. When they cross the square and depart from the wagon, they bring baskets of ice peppers with them. As they are doing this, Domon walks up and pretends to inspect the peppers. He tells them that the Whitecloaks and the Panarch's Legion are close to blows. He then leads the women towards the palace, announcing that they have ice peppers for the Panarch. They are directed to a storeroom. As they move to store away the peppers, they spot Marillin Gemalphin, who is scratching the ears of a scrawny cat. It is noted that she was once of the Brown Ajah, though she is now Black Ajah. Elayne becomes nervous, knowing that if Marillin were to notice them, she would know that they can channel in an instant. When they reach the storeroom and rid themselves of the peppers, they begin to change from the farm clothes that they are wearing into servant's dresses.\nWhen they leave the storeroom, they find that Marillin Gemalphin is no longer in sight. The chief cook notices them, thinking that they have come for the 'Lady Ispan's' breakfast. Elayne quickly curtsies and picks up a tray. She leaves, with Nynaeve and Egeanin close behind her. They make their way through the hallways, and Nynaeve prepares to part ways from the other two, threatening Egeanin should anything happen to Elayne. As they stand there talking, they hear noises outside and realize that the planned riot has started. Nynaeve disappears around a corner, and Elayne and Egeanin make their way to the Panarch's chambers. Inside, Elayne can feel someone channeling, and knows that there is one or more Black sisters within the room. As they listen, they hear someone - Amathera - singing bawdy songs.\nEgeanin throws the doors open, and inside they find that Amathera is wrapped in flows of Air. The Black sister within the room turns out to be Temaile. Appalled, Elayne embraces the Source and lashes out at Temaile with flows of Air, before shielding her. The Black sister goes flying across the room and falls unconscious.\nElayne and Egeanin demand to know if Amathera is alone, and Amathera is hesitant to speak. \"You are not...with them? You are Aes Sedai also? But not with them?\" When Elayne asks once again if she is alone, Amathera answers that yes, she is. She tells them of how the Black sisters had made her sit upon her throne and speak the words that they told her to. Sometimes they would make her dispense justice, and sometimes they would make her dispense horrible injustice. She adds that Temaile was the one who was set to watch over her, and that the Black sister had hurt her for no reason except to see her cry. Temaile made Amathera eat an entire tray full of white ice peppers and wouldn't let her drink a drop of water until she begged on her knees. In her dreams, she would hold her by her ankles atop the Tower of Morning, and she was forced to learn lewd dances and filthy songs. With this, she jumps at Temaile, beating on her. Elayne weaves flows of Air to draw the two apart.\nAmathera is convinced that what she must now do is contact her Legion of soldiers, but Elayne announces that she will do nothing of the sort. \"You will listen to me, Panarch Amathera of Tarabon. If you try to walk out to your soldiers, Temaile's cronies may very well tie you up in a bundle and hand you back to her. Worse, they will learn that my friends and I are here, and that I will not allow.\""

              "pov_summary": "Nynaeve is in the exhibition hall. She moves around, holding a feather duster so as not to cause suspicion should anyone else appear. She looks around, and then hurries over to the pedestal that holds the black collar and bracelets. She climbs over the rope meant to keep viewers away, and touches the collar. What she feels is suffering, agony and woe, so strong that she wants to weep. Thinking of how the Black Ajah wants to control Rand makes her angry enough to channel, and she embraces the Source just as a serving woman enters the hall. Nynaeve tries to look normal, dusting the collar and bracelets. As she looks at the woman's face, she suddenly knows it even though it is not the same face.\nNynaeve channels, weaving a hammer-hard flow of Air to smash the servant's face. The glow of saidar surrounds the woman and she reveals herself to be Moghedien. The Forsaken slices through Nynaeve's weave, causing her to stagger from the whiplash recoil. While Nynaeve is vulnerable, Moghedien forms a complex weave of Spirit streaked by Water and Air; Nynaeve has no idea what the purpose of the weave is. She tries to cut through the weave, and suddenly feels \"love, devotion, worship for the magnificent woman who would deign to allow her to?\"\nMoghedien's weave is destroyed, and Nynaeve remembers wanting to obey and grovel and please, and what happened at their previous meeting. This angers her again, and she forms a knife-sharp shield with which to still Moghedien. She lashes out, but her weave is blocked just short of severing Moghedien from the Source forever. Moghedien retaliates with the same weave, but Nynaeve also blocks it. Nynaeve is using all of her power to battle Moghedien, putting everything into holding off the other woman's attacks while trying to assail her at the same time.\nAs they face each other off, Moghedien begins to talk. \"All my careful planning, ruined. At the very least I shall have to go to untold effort to put everything back as it was. It may not be possible. Oh, I do mean to make you pay for that, Nynaeve al'Meara.\" She ponders out loud, wondering if she should take Nynaeve with her this time, or give her to Rahvin. The topic shifts to the collar and bracelets, and Moghedien wonders how Nynaeve found out about it, but says that it doesn't matter. She also explains a little about it. \"Put the collar on a man who channels, and a woman wearing the bracelets can make him do whatever she wishes, true, but it will not stop him going mad, and there is a flow the other way, too. Eventually he will begin to be able to control you, too, so you end with a struggle at every hour.\"\nAs Moghedien speaks, Nynaeve is thinking. She realizes that Moghedien's voice is tight with strain, and that the Forsaken is using all of her power against Nynaeve. As Moghedien continues to ramble on, Nynaeve is desperately thinking of a way to distract her. Finally, Nynaeve lets herself fall to the floor. Moghedien smiles and steps closer. As she does so, Nynaeve grabs the collar and hurls it at Moghedien. It strikes her between the eyes, and though the throw was not hard enough to stun her, it was certainly enough to surprise her.\nMoghedien's weaves falter slightly, giving Nynaeve the opening to slide her shield between the other woman and the Source. Nynaeve talks of torturing her, which seems to terrify Moghedien. She puts the collar and bracelets, as well as the seal that is still there, into her pouch. As Nynaeve pauses, Jeaine Caide suddenly appears, and she is carrying a fluted black rod with her - a ter'angreal that can produce balefire. She manages to jump out of the way just in time to avoid being hit with the weave. As the hall starts to fall apart, Nynaeve crawls away from the Black sister as fast as she can. By the time the balefire is over with, both Moghedien and Jeaine Caide have disappeared.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

She sees several of the Black sisters as she makes her way through the palace, including Liandrin and Rianna. She finally finds Elayne and Egeanin, along with Amathera, and hugs Elayne.\nElayne says that Amathera caused a little bit of trouble with trying to escape from them, but that it has all been sorted out. \"Do not scowl so, Nynaeve. I chased her down quickly, and we had a little talk. I think she is in perfect agreement with me now.\" Elayne then asks how Nynaeve's mission went, adding that when the palace started to shake (from the balefire) that she had had to restrain Egeanin from going to find her.\nNynaeve tells them that Moghedien had found her. She tells them about all that had happened, and Elayne is astounded that Nynaeve had captured Moghedien. She also assures them that she has the collar and bracelets as well as the seal.\nJuilin appears; he is injured. He urges the women to hurry \"before it gets out of hand.\" Past him, Nynaeve can see at least three hundred of Bayle Domon's sailors forming a semicircle about the door. Men are being jostled and are struggling and shouting in a seething mass, and they are barely held back by the sailors. Thom motions for them to hurry. When they leave the crowd behind, Thom bows to Amathera, saying that it is an honor to meet the Panarch. After a glance at Elayne she says, \"You mistake me, good sir. I am only a poor refugee from the countryside, rescued by these good women.\" The men are startled, but Elayne cuts in, saying that they should get back to the inn. When they arrive, Elayne turns 'Thera' over to Rendra, saying that she is a refugee with no money who \"needed a pallet and maybe some work to earn her meals.\"\nThe women begin talking, and Nynaeve wants to know how they almost let Amathera escape in the first place. Elayne changes the topic, saying that while Amathera does seem to have a true concern for justice, she has no idea what the lives of the common people are like.\nNynaeve opens her belt pouch and shows the others the seal and collar and bracelets. Bayle mentions that once he owned something like the seal that Nynaeve found, but she doubts him. Egeanin tells them that the collar and bracelets are not an a'dam, as an a'dam is made of a silvery metal and is all of one piece. Nynaeve replies that, \"It is at least as much like an a'dam as you and I are alike, Egeanin.\"\nJuilin tells them that he thinks both objects should be taken back to the White Tower, but Nynaeve refuses, thinking that some of the Aes Sedai might wish to use the collar and bracelets to control Rand. She asks if Elayne can destroy them. She tries, but to no effect. Instead, they decide to have Bayle Domon take them and drop them into a very deep part of the sea.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

              "pov_summary": "Perrin is sitting in the Winespring Inn writing a letter to Faile when Ban al'Seen appears to tell him that the Aiel are back from scouting. He says that there are thousands of Trollocs coming from the north and south. Perrin finishes writing his letter and he and Aram follow Ban out of the Inn. They find that all the women, children and Tinkers are gathered on the Green; the women are holding weapons. Daise Congar announces that if the Trollocs break through, that they will get the children out. Perrin says that he is sorry about what he did with Faile - that he arranged for her to leave Emond's Field before the attack. Alsbet Luhhan and Marin al'Vere say that they would have expected nothing less, and that they knew all along.\nPerrin leaves to go see to the men, and informs Ban and Tell that if things go badly that day, that they are in charge of getting the women and children to safety. They argue, but he will have none of it. He then tells Aram to stay with the Companions, but Aram insists on going wherever Perrin goes. On the west side of the Green, the Whitecloaks are sitting on their horses, and Perrin wants to know why they aren't in their battle places. Dain Bornhald tells Perrin that they are leaving, which angers the Companions. Perrin tells them that if they stay and fight that he will willingly go with them. \"Run! Or stay, if you can remember you're men. If you need to find the courage, look at the women, Bornhald. Any one of them is braver than the whole lot of you Whitecloaks!\" Bornhald becomes angry and informs his men that \"If we must die here, we will die clean!\" He agrees to stay, but only if Perrin keeps his promise.\nPerrin continues on, and finds men crouched with their halberds and polearms, waiting. Haral Luhhan and Abell Cauthon are among them. He then moves towards the south end of the village, where he finds Tam al'Thor readying more men for battle. Alanna and Ihvon are also there, and the Aes Sedai is fussing over one of the catapults.\nPerrin decides that he will fight at the north side of the village, as north is the direction that Faile had taken out of Emond's Field. Bran is in charge, and Loial, Gaul and Chiad are with him. As they wait, Perrin contemplates all the familiar faces around him: Eward Candwin, Paet al'Caar, Buel Dowtry, Jac al'Seen, Wit Congar, Flann Lewin, Jaim Torfinn, Hu Marwin, Elam Dowtry, Dav Ayellin, Egwin Finngar, Hari and Darl Coplin, Bili Congar, Berin Thane, Athan Dearn, Kevrim al'Azar, Tuck Padwhin...the list goes on and on, and Perrin forces himself to stop reciting names. Verin then rides up, and Perrin tells her that he is surprised that she and Alanna are still there. Verin tells him that \"Could I only split myself into three, I would latch one onto each of you [referring to him, Rand and Mat] and follow you every moment of the day and night even if I had to marry you.\"\nAs they finish talking, there is suddenly a shout of 'Isam!' from thousands of approaching Trollocs. As he fights among the other Emond's Fielders, he keeps reminding himself that Faile is safe and that nothing else matters. The battle rages, with Trollocs and even Myrddraal falling to arrows and stones from the catapults. Verin makes her way from catapult to catapult, and everyone fights with everything they have.\nAs the fighting continues on, the Two Rivers line begins to bulge inward at a dozen places, and Perrin knows that if it breaks in even one spot that all will be lost. He shouts an order for everyone to fall back among the houses. A Trolloc attacks Perrin just as everyone begins to back up, but Aram kills it.\nAs they keep fighting, Perrin suddenly notices that the women are fighting side by side with the men. He sees Daise Congar, Marin al'Vere, Bodewhin and Eldrin Cauthon, Neysa Ayellin and more...all of them are trying to swell the men's ranks, trying to keep the line from breaking. Perrin knows that they are the only reason that the line is still holding. As Perrin begins to wonder where the Whitecloaks are, a boy runs up to him with a message. \"Lord Perrin! Please listen! Master al'Thor says somebody's attacking the Trollocs!\" When Perrin asks who is attacking, the boy says that he does not know, but that \"Master al'Vere said to tell you he thought he heard somebody shouting 'Deven Ride.' \"\nAs the young boy returns to the other children, Perrin continues to fight, until the messenger returns; \"Lord Perrin! Master al'Vere said to tell you the Trollocs are breaking! And they are shouting 'Deven Ride'! The men, I mean. I heard them!\" Perrin asks what the boy's name is, and when the boy replies that he is Jaim Aybara and is \"your cousin, I think. Sort of, anyway,\" Perrin has to close his eyes against the tears.\nThe battle against the Trollocs has ended, and as Perrin rides through mounds of dead Trollocs, he sees Faile riding towards him. She tells him that she had never promised that she would actually leave the Two Rivers. \"I said I would go. I did not say how far.\" All Perrin can do is look at her. She continues on, telling him that the Watch Hill men, who she brought with her to help in the battle, were ready, and that she barely had to say anything to convince them to come. She is very proud of herself; \"They followed me, Perrin. They followed me! Even Tenobia has never led men into battle.\" Thinking that he is angry, she tells him that he has no right to be mad, but he cuts in and tells her that he loves her. They embrace, Faile telling Perrin about how afraid she was that she wouldn't make it. She then asks if the Deven Ride men came. Perrin wonders if she arranged that as well as the rescue from the Watch Hill men. She says that when \"that man came with his message - 'We are coming' - I thought - hoped - that that was what it meant.\" She then asks him to not be angry with her, and Perrin starts to say that he will never be mad at her again, but Faile makes him promise not to say that. \"Mother says the worst thing Father ever did to her was vow never to be angry with her.\"\nWhen Perrin once again begins to pay attention to his surroundings, he sees many familiar faces emerge from the carnage; all he can think about is the faces that are still there, not the faces that aren't. Along with the people from his childhood, he sees people that he doesn't know, people that must be from Watch Hill and Deven Ride. As he looks around, the Whitecloaks appear, with Dain Bornhald at their head. Bornhald announces that since the battle is over, he will now arrest Perrin as they had agreed. Faile cries out, demanding to know if Perrin really agreed to a deal with Bornhald. The crowd around them begins to shout; \"No! No!\" and \"You will not take him!\" and \"Goldeneyes!\" Perrin becomes angry and tells Bornhald that \"I said I would not resist, if you aided. If you aided, Whitecloak. Where were you?\" Daise Congar steps forward, and tells Perrin that during the battle the Whitecloaks stayed on the Green, and that that was what had prompted the women to join the battle. Bornhald becomes enraged, saying that he hadn't trusted Perrin, and that his 'plan' only failed because of the help that arrived. As some of the Whitecloaks draw their swords, the Two Rivers men level their bows at the Children of the Light, ready to defend Perrin and Faile. Eventually Bornhald leaves, but not before promising to one day see Perrin hang.\nAfter the Whitecloaks have left, a group of ten or twelve men approach Perrin. The man that seems to be their leader bows to Perrin and says that his name is Jerinvar Barstere. He says that some of his men will make sure that the Whitecloaks leave, if it's okay with Perrin, and that many people from his village wish to get home as soon as possible. He bows again, as do the other men. After he walks away, Faile informs Perrin that Jerinvar Barstere is the Mayor of Watch Hill and that \"The Watch Hill Women's Circle will be sending a delegation down under their Wisdom once they're certain it is safe.\" Perrin and Faile then head off towards the Winespring Inn."

              "pov_summary": "Rand is thinking back on the last few days. Finally, they arrive at Alcair Dal, only to find that Couladin and the Shaido have already arrived. As the men prepare to enter Alcair Dal, Bair warns Rand to be careful. \"A tired man makes mistakes. You cannot afford mistakes today.\" The women will not be entering Alcair Dal at this time, as it is time for the clan chiefs to meet without the Wise Ones. Moiraine approaches him, and says that since she cannot accompany him, to please let Lan take her place. Rand refuses. \"Let Lan stay with you, Moiraine. Far Dareis Mai carries my honor.\" This pleases the Maidens.\nAs they are about to enter the meeting place, Mat decides to accompany Rand and the clan chiefs, and Rand agrees. As Rand asks Rhuarc if it is time yet, they hear singing - a battle song.\nWash the spears - while the sun climbs high. Wash the spears - while the sun falls low. Wash the spears - Who fears to die? Wash the spears - No one I know!\nThe song continues and as it does, the Taardad appear, running in time to their song in two wide columns, their spears ready and faces veiled. Before they can enter, they are stopped by another Clan Chief, Mandhuin of the Goshien. They find out that the Shaido arrived at sunrise, and that the Goshien, Sharaad, Chareen and Tomanelle Aiel are also there. Rand, Mat, the Clan Chiefs and the Maidens finally enter Alcair Dal, which is a large, round canyon with a ledge on which the speakers can stand. Sevanna is in the middle of demanding that Couladin be allowed to speak. Han, of the Tomanelle Aiel, argues, saying that only people who have entered Rhuidean may speak; since Couladin was refused entrance to the city, Han concludes, Couladin does not have the right to speak. Bael breaks in, and says that they have gathered to hear an announcement, but only when the other clans arrive. \"If all Sevanna wishes to speak of now is letting Couladin speak, I will go back to my tents and wait.\" Now it is Jheran of the Shaarad who breaks in, saying that he wishes to discuss the water at Chain Ridge Stand.\nSuddenly, everyone notices the new arrivals. Han demands to know why Rhuarc has brought Wetlanders to Alcair Dal. Rhuarc replies, saying that Rand has come to speak to the clan chiefs, and asks if the Dreamwalkers perhaps did not inform him of this. Bael says that Melaine has told him many things, such as the fact that He Who Comes With the Dawn has appeared. He stares at Rand, and asks in disbelief if this is what Rand means to speak of.\nSevanna breaks in once again. \"If this Wetlander can speak, so may Couladin.\" Couladin steps forward, announces that he is the Car'a'carn, and shows the assembled crowd his forearms...both are marked with glittering dragons. The Aiel spectators leap to their feet, shouting and cheering, and the Taardad are astounded.\nRand keeps his calm, and simply steps forward to join Couladin. He holds up his arms, and waits until the crowd notices the dragons that are wound around his own forearms. Couladin continues to speak, at first not aware of what Rand has done. When he hears the silence that has descended, he knows that it is because Rand has joined him. He shouts out that Rand is a Wetlander, and therefore cannot be the Car'a'carn.\nRand agrees that he is a Wetlander, but has more to say than that. \"What does the Prophecy of Rhuidean say? 'Born of the blood.' My mother was Shaiel, a Maiden of the Chumai Taardad. My father was Janduin, of the Iron Mountain Sept, Clan Chief of the Taardad.\" He points out that the prophecy reads 'Born of the blood, but raised by those not of the blood.' Reluctantly, the clan chiefs nod their heads in agreement. Couladin only sneers at him, saying that the words of the prophecy have most likely changed over time.\nRhuarc strides to the front of the ledge, and announces that this is all madness, as Couladin has never been to Rhuidean. Couladin replies that he went to Rhuidean without the permission of the Wise Ones. Rand finally decides to end this charade once and for all, and asks Couladin what he saw in Rhuidean. Couladin tells Rand that everyone knows that Rhuidean is not to be spoken of. Erim, Clan Chief of the Chareen, suggests that they step aside to discuss this. Couladin angrily cuts in, saying, \"I will speak of it with no one. Rhuidean is a holy place, and what I saw was holy. I am holy!\" Rand tells everyone that when he went to Rhuidean, he saw the history of the Aiel through the eyes of his ancestors. Sevanna insists that Rhuarc told him that. Han reprimands her, saying that Rhuarc is a man of honour and would not do such a thing.\nCouladin announces aloud that he is not afraid to speak. He tells them that he also saw with the eyes of his ancestors, and that he saw the glory that he will bring back to them. Rand replies: \"I saw the Age of Legends, and the beginning of the Aiel journey to the Three-fold Land. I saw the Aiel when they were called the Da'shain Aiel, and followed the Way of the Leaf.\"\nAlcair Dal erupts into cries of denial as the Aiel refuse to believe what Rand has said. People are staring at Rand with stricken looks on their faces. As Couladin eggs them on, insisting that Rand is a liar, Bael speaks, and pronounces Rand the Car'a'carn. His proclamation is followed by ones from Han, Jheran, Erim and Rhuarc. Pandemonium follows, and Couladin hurls a spear at Rand. Adelin leaps in front of him, and is wounded.\nRand has finally had enough of it, and reaches for saidin. In an effort to stop the chaos, he causes it to rain, something that has never happened in the Aiel Waste. Abruptly, someone forms a domed barrier around Rand; it is Lanfear. She berates him for what he has done. Rand says that he hadn't expected Lanfear to reveal herself so soon, and when she seems surprised, he tells her that he knew from the day he left Tear that she was following him. He demands to know where Lanfear's accomplice is. As Lanfear begins to speak again of the two sa'angreal with which they can rule the world, Rand reaches out to saidin again and opens a gateway to Rhuidean. When she asks what is of import in Rhuidean, Rand responds that Asmodean is there, and leaves.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

              "pov_summary": "The gateway/portal that Rand has opened leads into a darkness that is devoid of any sensation. He finds steps of pale, gray stone leading ever upwards. He starts to run up the stairs, and notices that as his feet leaves each step, it fades out of existence. As he climbs, he wonders if he created them with the power, or if they had already existed; with this thought the stairs beneath his feet begin to fade, and the ones ahead of him start to shimmer. Desperate, he concentrates on solid gray stone, and they reappear, but polished and engraved this time. Before his thoughts can lead to the deterioration of the steps again, he begins to run as fast as he can. He knows that they will lead him to where he wants to go, but can't help but wonder how long it will take. Eventually, he sees a figure ahead, standing on a platform of silver that slides through the darkness, and Rand knows that it is Asmodean. Rand stops, and thinks of a silver platform for himself; one materializes beneath his feet and begins to glide forward.\nAs Rand begins to catch up to Asmodean, he notices what seems to be black threads, like fine steel wires, that run off from the man and disappear into the surrounding darkness. When Asmodean turns his head, Rand is astounded to see the face of Jasin Natael; he had been certain that the Forsaken would have taken on the identity of Hadnan Kadere. When Asmodean sees him, he is surprised, and a huge sheet of fire appears and sweeps towards Rand, who channels at it and causes it to vanish. As they continue moving forwards, Rand and Asmodean try to attack each other several times, but neither succeeds.\nFinally, the platforms stop, and Rand is thrown through the doorway by his momentum. He finds that he has been deposited not fifty steps from Rhuidean. Once again, both of the men channel at each other, but again, neither succeeds in harming the other. The attacks soon become a race to see who can reach the city first. When they reach the plaza containing all of the ter'angreal, Asmodean leaps towards a small, white stone figurine of a man holding a crystal sphere in one upraised hand. He lets out an exultant cry, but Rand's hands latch onto it a heartbeat later. They both reach through the ter'angreal, drawing saidin through it. Rand is faintly aware of the half-buried statue of the same figurine, only many, many times larger, pulsing with the One Power in Cairhien. Both Rand and Asmodean are attempting to wield saidin through the strongest male sa'angreal ever created.\nThey struggle back and forth, both trying to gain an advantage over the other. While holding onto the ter'angreal, they continue their battle, trying to kill each other with saidin, but they are equally matched. Finally, in desperation, Rand reaches for the fat little man angreal. He knows that compared to the great sa'angreal it is insignificant, but he hopes that it might give him a slight advantage over Asmodean.\nRand can still sense the black steel wires around Asmodean, and he suddenly becomes calm. He reaches through the angreal, and forms a sword of Power, of Light, and strikes at the wires.\nAsmodean screams, and for an instant it looks as if there are two of him, shivering away from each other and then sliding back together. He falls over, and his eyes look lost.\nRand finally lets go of saidin, and looks around. The plaza is a mess, with palaces and towers lying in heaps of rubble. He also notices that the fog that had surrounded Rhuidean for centuries has begun to dissipate. \"I destroy. Always I destroy! Light, will it ever end?\"\nAsmodean pushes himself to his hands and knees and begins to crawl towards Rand. Rand threatens him, and Asmodean stops.\nLanfear appears. She comments on the ter'angreal that Rand is still holding, saying that she had thought that it, and all like it, were destroyed. She tells him that he has just used one of the two sa'angreal that she had told him about, the ones that they could use to rule the world together. \"With those, together, we can displace the Great Lord of the Dark himself. We can, Lews Therin! Together.\"\nAsmodean cries out to Lanfear for help, and begins to crawl towards her. Rand tells her that he has cut Asmodean off from the Dark One, and her eyes widen in shock as she says that she had not thought it possible. Asmodean pleads for Lanfear's help, but she refuses. She says that instead, she will tell all the other Forsaken that he has gone over to Rand's side, and he cries out in denial. When Asmodean calls out to Lanfear, using her real name of Mierin, she becomes enraged and Rand is afraid that she will kill him. He pulls in as much of saidin as he can...not much, considering how exhausted he is...and throws a weave between the two; the weave turns out to be balefire.\nRand asks Lanfear if she means to harm anyone in Alcair Dal, and Lanfear wants to know whom he thinks she might kill. \"I thought you had realized you did not love that little farmgirl. Or is it the Aiel jade?\" Rand tells her that he simply doesn't want anyone to get hurt, as he can still use them. It is painful for him to say this, but he knows that he must if he doesn't want Lanfear to kill anyone. She just laughs. Rand asks her which one she was, meaning which disguise did she use to get into the Aiel Waste? She ends up telling him that she was Keille Shaogi. She then tells him to learn quickly, and leaves.\nRand approaches Asmodean, and finds another figurine just like his, only female. Asmodean tells Rand that Lanfear would rip his heart out to put her hands on it. They start back for Alcair Dal, using the same method to leave Rhuidean as they did to arrive. Rand tells Asmodean that he needs a name that he can call him by; he had decided a while ago that he would use Asmodean as his teacher. They settle on just referring to Asmodean as Jasin Natael, Gleeman to the Dragon Reborn, and Rand tells him that the first thing he wants to learn is how to guard his dreams. Eventually, they arrive back at Alcair Dal.\nThe rain has stopped, and Rand notices that there are approximately a fourth fewer Aiel than were there before. Moiraine, Egwene, Aviendha, the Wise Ones and Lan have joined the Clan Chiefs and Maidens on the ledge. He is told that the Shaido have left, as have many other Aiel who couldn't handle the revelation of the history of the Aiel. All that are left are the ones who will follow Rand.\n<< Previous Chapter / Next Book (Prologue) >>"

As much as they wish to share anyway. They don't address the really important issues so Elaida doesn't get involved in the meeting. Danelle brings up fighting in Shienar. Between Shienarans even. It is almost unheard of for Borderlanders to fight each other. They have the Blight to fight. Teslyn brings up the Saldaean army on the move to intercept Mazrim Taim. News of his escape must be slipping out. It seems Queen Tenobia of Saldaea doesn't trust the Tower to handle it. Alviarin suggests sending an Aes Sedai advisor to Saldaea to guide Tenobia. The other sisters agree and the matter is decided upon without even a glance at Elaida. This has been happening a lot lately and Elaida has had enough of it. She is the Amyrlin now and they will learn to respect her.\nThe discussion meanwhile moves on the rumours about the Whitecloaks and the disappearance of Panarch Amathera. Elaida's attention wanders again to some of the decorations she has added after moving in to the office. Elayne is discussed now. Rumour has it that Queen Morgase of Andor is being kept busy by her new lover Lord Gaebril and her claim to the Cairhienin Sun throne. Elaida studies the paintings in the room everybody else ignores. One of the last Red Amyrlin Bonwhin, she was stripped of staff and stole after nearly destroying the Tower in the days of Artur Hawkwing. A reminder of the price of failure. The other is of a more recent scene, two men fighting in the clouds.\nAlviarin now closes the meeting again without consulting the Amyrlin. Elaida speaks up for the first time. She didn't permit anyone to leave yet. The furious former Red points the gathered sisters to what is really important, matters they didn't dare mention - finding 'that woman' as Elaida now refers to her predecessor Siuan Sanche. Joline, who is in charge of this, comes up with the usual excuses. Elaida tells her to set a punishment for herself and redouble her efforts. Gathering the sisters who have fled or are scattered across the lands is not progressing very well either. Elaida tells Javindhra to try harder or she will face a punishment too.\nThen Elaida moves on to the most important matter of all. Rand al'Thor, the Dragon Reborn. She tells the sisters that they cannot ignore this matter. The Last Battle is coming, there is no doubt about it. Yet the are afraid to even look at his picture. She demands each of them writes down what they did to bring him under the control of the Tower. And now they may leave.\nAll save the Keeper do. Alviarin still seems to think herself the equal of the Amyrlin, Elaida will have to do something about that as well. But not just now. An Accepted announces a man named Fain. He claims to be from Lugard, but he speaks with several accents. A strange fellow he is but potentially useful. She sends Alviarin away and concentrates on Fain for now."

The Horn is in the Tower even if not many know it and so is the dagger. Fain can feel its pull. He turns his attention to the Amyrlin now. She wants to know about Rand al'Thor. She may be able to give al'Thor to him."

Holding on to the Power he tells her to send an emissary if she wants to speak with him. None of the Forsaken trust each other. It turns out Lanfear organized a meeting here. She went ahead to make sure he didn't take it as an attack. Graendal and Sammael arrive shortly after.\nExchanging the usual sneers, insults and other pleasantries the four Chosen discuss the situation. Four are dead so far and it seems Asmodean went over to the other side. Not that Rahvin minds al'Thor removing some of the weaker Forsaken. Lanfear proposes a kind of pact between the four. No need to share the spoils between more of them than necessary. She will keep an eye on him until it is time to act. Until then the others are to hold back. Rahvin can see how this could work to his advantage. It might work well indeed.\n<< Previous Book | Next Chapter >>"

They were seeking shelter for the night there when the owner caught them. Logain knocked the man down and made a run for it. In the process Admer Ned dropped his lantern resulting in the loss of the barn and several cows. Min, Siuan and Leane, those are not the names they are using now of course, are now waiting for the local lord to settle the matter. Min asks Siuan what she thinks their penalty will be. Siuan seems to think a strapping on the village square is most likely. Siuan is obviously frustrated by not finding a word on a gathering of Aes Sedai and by this new obstacle in their way.\nLeane is making adjustments to her dress. When she is done she takes out the case with make up Min is still carrying around. Min wants to know if Leane is going to take up flirting. As it turns out that is exactly what she has in mind, she might get them a lighter sentence. Siuan doesn't believe that is all of the reason. Leane tells her she will take up acting as a Domani woman to try and fill the void stilling has left.\nThey\u200b are lead before the local lord, Gareth Bryne, and Admer Nem makes his case. He tells a more or less true version of the event although he omits the part where Bryne's men were in time to stop a hanging, embellishes the fight to make himself look better and exaggerates how much was stolen. Min also doubts the part about a stolen purse but she doesn't quite put it beyond Logain. Leane speaks in defence of them and her new-found grace and Domani manners seem to help a bit. Lord Bryne will cover Nem's losses and the three of them will work for him to repay the debt. Depending on whether they are willing to swear an oath to serve him they will work in the manor or the fields, with or without guards. To Min's amazement Siuan swears to work to pay the debt on her hope of rebirth and salvation, the strongest oath there is. Leane and Min soon follow her example.\nA guard named Joni is assigned to take them to the manor in a wagon. Siuan explains that she was very careful not to suggest they would serve right now and that she intends to make a run for it as soon as she is sure they aren't guarded. She has met Bryne before and she was afraid he might recognize her voice. She regrets having to cross him, it seems the man has a backbone. Then Logain appears and knocks out Joni. It turns out he did indeed steal that purse but he won't hand it over to Siuan. After a bit of arguing they decide to go on together for now. When that is decided Min sees the aura of glory around him again."

Bryne is for some reason more intrigued by the girl from Tear.\nGareth turns to the group of graying, experienced soldiers he is taking with him on this chase. Dependable men every one of them. Then one of his men comes back from New Braem, a small city not too\u200b far from the Bryne estate. He tells him of the fall of the Stone and a man who drew Callandor, of the deposing of Siuan Sanche, her death and the death of the false Dragon Logain.

Alteima has heard rumours about Morgase having a new lover. When she sees the Queen in a dress she wouldn't have worn for any man before it becomes clear who is dominant in their relationship. Morgase is obviously in love and probably quite protective.\nMorgase asks how her husband is. This is a setback for Alteima, she didn't think Morgase would remember that. They only met once. She replies that he was well last time she saw him and that he is now serving the Dragon Reborn. Morgase remembers Rand, her advisor Elaida warned her about him. Alteima asks Morgase if she has replaced Elaida now that she is Amyrlin. That seems to be a dangerous subject. Morgase says she most certainty did not replace her yet she seems very proud of her daughter Elayne who has been raised to Accepted. Morgase tells her she wants to know about Rand. That is the opening Alteima has been waiting for.\nGaebril now enters the room and Morgase beams at him. Gaebril tells Morgase she should rest for a while. The annoyed look on her face quickly disappears when he puts a hand on her shoulder. She leaves the room. Gaebril now starts asking Alteima questions and she feels the urge to answer him with the truth, to please him like Morgase can't even think of. She tells him she tried to murder her husband and that she is now here because of it, she tells about what happened in Tear everything Gaebril wants to know."

Rand already took what he needed. Aiel have been moving in the city, occupying many of the buildings and starting to cultivate crops with water from the new formed lake. Rand can see the burnt remains of the Tree of Life. Moiraine says the tree still lives and will produce shoots again.\nRand turns his attention back to the six Aiel clan chiefs in the room. Only six of the twelve Aiel clans represented. Rand wants to know what he has to do to get the others to join him. The clan chiefs agree that there is not much to do but to wait. The revelation of Aiel descending from pacifists has shocked the clans to the core. They need time to deal with it. Even now Aiel are throwing down their weapons and simply walking away from their way of life. The bleakness as it is called has taken many Aiel already. The Shaido are unlikely to join Rand though. Couladin leads them now, even though he is not a clan chief. He has been telling people he is the Dragon Reborn and that Rand lied to them. There isn't much news from the other side of the Dragonwall either. Rand sees Moiraine and Egwene waiting for him to conclude the meeting. There is nothing more to discuss so Rand tells the clan chiefs to keep an eye on the Shaido and bring in the other clans.\nJasin Natael is still playing his harp in the background as Egwene and Moiraine approach. Moiraine tells him the wagons with Power-related objects will be loaded soon. Rand says she'd better send a strong guard with them or Kadere won't deliver them to Tar Valon. Rand wants to know what Moiraine came to do. His rude demand is punished by one of the women by a weave of Air striking him. Rand can't tell which of them did it but he won't be provoked. Moiraine wants him to send Jasin Natael away but Rand refuses. Jasin can hear whatever Moiraine has to say. Egwene thinks Rand's head is getting big indeed.\nMoiraine shows him one of the seals she found in Rhuidean. It is so brittle that it could be smashed with a hammer. The seals that hold the Dark One imprisoned are weakening. The one she brought with her from Tear is in the same condition. Rand is not ready to fight the Last Battle yet. Moiraine wants to know what Rand is planning. He refuses to tell her and she accuses him of hiding. He left a trail of destruction behind him but he can't stay in the Waste forever. Thus provoked Rand tells he means to bring eleven Aiel clans over the Dragonwall to unite the lands, by force if need be. Moiraine seems to think this is the worst thing he can do. Surely the White Tower is uniting the lands behind the Dragon Reborn as they speak. Rand laughs and tells Moiraine if she still thinks she and Siuan know everything she is a fool. Moiraine just tells him to be very careful and leaves him with an upset Egwene.\nAfter Moiraine leaves Egwene tells him he is an ill-mannered lout and a few more things like that. Rand is amazed at the tirade. Then a voice in his head speaks up and Rand freezes. He has no idea where it came from. Egwene stops her tirade and looks at him worried. She asks if something is wrong, if she should get Moiraine to Heal him. Rand says this is not something that can be Healed. He changes the subject and asks how Elayne is. Egwene just wants to say she is well and gets ready to leave. She tells him to get some rest. A goblet of wine floats up to Rand and he snatches it out of the air. He promises Egwene he'll get some rest. Before she leaves Egwene tells him Elayne loves him. When she is gone Rand throws the goblet away and furiously turns around to face Natael.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

Asmodean tells him they wouldn't suspect anyway. Women can't see the flows woven by men. Rand uses the captured Forsaken to teach him. Only a man who can channel can do that and the only men who can Rand has come across are the Forsaken. Not much of a choice but he must learn.\nAsmodean isn't much of a teacher. The process is frustrating Rand but he will get as much information out of the man as he can. He asks again about the other Forsaken but Asmodean can't provide much new information on them. Conversation turns to linking. Why can women link without men but men can't without women? Asmodean doesn't seem to know. He doesn't seem to think his chances of survival, or Rand's for that matter, are very big. He intends to kill himself before the Dark One breaks free and deals out a punishment for Asmodean's betrayal.\nA group of Maidens walk into the room to get Rand. Like the clan chiefs the Maidens are uneasy about the change Rand has brought. Not only the bleakness but quite a few of them have given up the spear to marry recently.

He doesn't stop to talk to any of the Maidens but he does answer them with a smile. Rand had chosen this building to stay in because it was finished and kept the day's heat and the night's cold out for the most part. One day he found the Maidens had just moved in with him and expected him to stay. At least he managed to convince them to keep the floor he was using for himself.\nRand goes to the room he has for himself. He is upset that he let Moiraine know about his plans. She has a way of getting him angry enough to give away stuff he didn't want anybody to know yet. In a way he can trust Asmodean more than he can trust her. Asmodean needs him, Moiraine sees him as means to an end.\nAviendha walks into the room with a pile of blankets. Rand asks where she has been the past ten days. He'd expected her to watch him more closely after he locked the Wise Ones out of his dreams. A useful trick Asmodean taught him. She tells him she had training to do. The Wise Ones were not pleased with what Rand did and even less pleased with Aviendha letting him know. Rand doesn't think she did anything wrong but Aviendha thinks she dishonored herself in some way. Ji'e'toh remains a mystery to Rand.\nAfter Aviendha throws the blankets at him it becomes clear what she came to see him for. She has brought him a gift made from the weapons she has given up to become a Wise One. Bair told her to give the three men and three women she hated most such a gift and she hopes it will cancel out the debt she owes him for the gift he gave her. Rand will release her from having her teach him Aiel customs if she hates him that much but Aviendha says she owes it to Elayne to watch out for him. Not for the first time she reminds him he belongs to Elayne. Rand thinks about the two letters Elayne wrote him and doubts she still wants to have anything to do with him. He says as much to Aviendha.\nAt that moment, the worst possible timing Rand thinks, Isendre walks into his room. The Maidens caught her stealing and as a punishment they shaved her head and let her wear nothing but the jewels she stole. Aviendha tells her she has been warned about this. Rand tries to protect Isendre but Aviendha will have nothing of it. This is Maiden's business. She sends Isendre away to report to the first Maiden she sees. Then she turns on Rand and tells him to stop encouraging her. He belongs to Elayne. Isendre has been caught seven times already trying to sneak into Rand's bed. Rand says he didn't encourage her but Aviendha doesn't believe him. After another reminder he is Elayne's she leaves him. Rand goes to bed and shields his dreams. They are of Min, Aviendha and Elayne and mostly pleasant ones.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

The Aiel see it differently and will go if Rand leads them out of the waste. The discussion goes back and forth a bit but their positions don't change. Bair dismisses Moiraine politely.\nWhen Moiraine is gone the Wise Ones tell Aviendha to pour tea. She flushes and says she hasn't made any yet. She hurries out of the tent to do so. Egwene notices she has been beaten recently. She asks Bair about it and she says Aviendha asked her to because she lied twice today. Egwene thinks all Aiel must be crazy. Amys brings up the bleakness. She has heard some of the Aiel who are taken by it join the Lost Ones, the Aiel name for the Tinkers. They seem to be in the Waste in greater numbers than ever before.\nAviendha returns with tea and Amys asks Egwene how Rand would take it if Aviendha asks to sleep in his room. Egwene is shocked because it just isn't proper. Aviendha asks the Wise Ones not to make her do it. She hates the man. The Wise Ones will have none of it though and in the end Egwene has to admit he might if they give him a good enough reason. The Wise Ones will think of one.\nThen they turn their attention to Egwene's training. Egwene still has trouble finding other people's dreams. Amys tells her she expects to dream of Egwene tonight. Being so close Egwene should be able to find her. Bair breaks up the meeting after that. Melaine wants to discuss one more thing though. She wants Bair and Amys to talk to Dorindha, the wife of Clan Chief Bael about becoming sister-wives. Having two wives is another custom Egwene can't get used to.\nWhen Egwene wants to go outside she notices her clothes are gone. Bair says she won't need them. She sets a punishment for Egwene for not responding promptly to a Wise One's summons and for Aviendha for neglecting her duties and failing to have the tea ready. Fifty laps around the camp. While they run Egwene tells Aviendha they can't make her sleep in Rand's room. Aviendha says her honour makes her obey the Wise Ones. Egwene says she doesn't understand ji'e'toh but Aviendha says Egwene lives by it none the less.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

              "pov_summary": "Rand wakes up in the middle of the night, unsure of what woke him. He feels something foul approaching. Quickly he gets up grabs saidin and moves to another part of the building where he can fight it without any other people getting hurt. Then he waits for the enemy to approach. Three pony-sized dogs appear. Rand thinks a sword should be enough to kill them. He dances the forms among them and soon the dogs are dead. He underestimated them though, the dogs turn into a kind of liquid shadow and the pools of liquid draw together again. Soon the dogs are before him once more. Remembering a weave that might work a bar of liquid light hits the dogs and they disappear. He uses too much of the Power though and a part of the wall disappears too.\nMoiraine has entered the room and wants to know if any of the dogs bled on him or bit him. Rand wants to know why the Maidens let her in. They grant Moiraine some Wise One privileges it seems. The dogs were Darkhounds, their blood and saliva are poison. She may not have been able to Heal those wounds. She tells him they must speak of what he used to kill the Darkhounds. She also says packs are usually larger. Rand cuts her off at that and runs out to see if there are more Darkhounds around. Lan sees him storming past and wants to know where Moiraine is but Rand doesn't reply.\nHe sees three more Darkhounds trying to claw their way into a building Mat is sleeping in. He uses the same weave and manages to control it better this time. The door is heavily damaged but Mat only has a minor injury on his arm. Moiraine and Lan arrive at the scene and Moiraine tries to Heal Mat's Darkhound wound. The foxhead medallion blocks her weaves though. Reluctantly Mat takes it off. When Mat is Healed Rand breaks up the crowd. Moiraine wants to talk to him alone.\nRand wants to wait till tomorrow and he makes it quite clear he will not help her get that medallion. Mat paid a high price for it and it is his. Moiraine now resorts to pleading to get Rand to listen. Lan doesn't like this one bit and his opinion of Rand drops even further when Moiraine takes an oath to obey him and apologizes for any offence she may have given. This gets Rand's attention. He accepts her help and apology and apologizes for acting rude towards her.\nMoiraine now explains the dangers of balefire, the weave Rand used to destroy the Darkhounds. Balefire pulls a thread from the Pattern. Whatever the creature did till a certain point before it was balefired ceases to exist. In the War of the Shadow whole cities were destroyed using this weapon until both sides realized the Pattern might unravel. The weave is forbidden by the Tower. Rand has seen Moiraine use it once though. Rand can't promise not to use it again.\nRand now opens a gateway, something Moiraine didn't know he could do, to check on someone and tells her he'll see her in the morning. Darkhounds had been near Asmodean's quarters. Did his traps destroy them or did they go back to report? Rand removes the tracks and goes to check on the powerful ter'angreal he hid elsewhere. They too are where he left them.\nLanfear shows up and sees him with the ter'angreal, she thinks he is considering her plan. Lews Therin speaks up and tells Lanfear she is only ambition. Once he saw that, he didn't love her anymore. Lanfear says Asmodean has been telling lies about her. Rand wants to know why she is here. She tells him Rahvin sent the Darkhounds tonight. He is in Caemlyn using Morgase as a puppet to control Andor and gain the Sun Throne. With Rand's Tairen soldiers moving into Cairhien and Rahvin's Andoran soldiers crossing the border as well, something has to be done soon.\nLanfear now wants to know why he wards his dreams against her. He tells her he wards his dreams against everyone. He doesn't mention she is high on the list of people he wants to keep out though. Lanfear claims she can break through and he wouldn't like it if she did. She has been looking at the Wise Ones dreams as well, and Egwene's. Lanfear seems to think he will get jealous if she tells him Egwene dreams of the princes of Andor. Then someone approaches and Lanfear disappears through a gateway.\nEnaila comes in and\u200b tells him the clan chiefs have come to see him. The Shaido are on the move. And the other clans as well. They are heading for the Jangai Pass. If they leave now they won't catch the Shaido before they enter Cairhien. Rand gives the order to rouse the spears and prepare to leave at dawn anyway. He means to be as close behind them as he can.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

The running she did last night isn't why she is tired. She managed to find Amys' dreams last night. To celebrate they sipped tea together in their dreams. After that Egwene visited a number of other dreams. Rand's were warded of course and she stayed away from the Wise Ones' dreams. Isendre's dreams had been nothing short of a nightmare while Kadere's were lewd.\nEgwene makes her way to the Maidens' roof to find Aviendha. Rand is already up giving orders to ask Ogier to rebuild Rhuidean. Mat is there as well. He seems to be on very good terms with one of the Maidens. Mat tells her Moiraine has started to obey Rand. That seems like the sun rising at midnight to Egwene. She doesn't understand it.\nFinally she spots Aviendha. She is staring at Rand. It seems the trouble between them is still not solved. Egwene tells her again she will talk to the Wise Ones if Aviendha will let her. Aviendha won't have any of that and asks her to stop offering. Egwene says she doesn't have to be afraid of him but that seems to be the wrong thing to say. Aviendha is afraid of no man. Or so she claims. Her dreams indicate otherwise.\nRand is ready to leave. One of the people in the crowd asks if he means to return. Rand says he doesn't know but he leaves them with a final gift. Using the One Power he draws water from the earth and makes the fountains in Rhuidean work. So much water is a miracle for the Aiel. Seeing him channel still makes Egwene uneasy. Seeing Aviendha fall in beside Rand, Egwene is determined to help her somehow."

All possible futures are too much for one mind to hold but some warnings and lessons stayed in your mind.\nLan speaks and says he doesn't like seeing his Aes Sedai worried. He wants to know if the Last Battle is coming. She replies she doesn't know but she hopes that will be a while off still. Then why is she so desperate to stay close to Rand he wants to know. Moiraine says he needs all the guidance she can give him and that she will do anything short of sharing his bed to see that he gets it. Not sharing his bed was one of the lessons the ter'angreal taught her. If she could only remember why...\nLan wants to know if that includes lighting his pipe and fetching his slippers. If that was a joke Moiraine can't appreciate it. Her Warder is changing and a Wisdom from the Two Rivers is at the heart of it. At least she had taken care of that. Lan was not the only one changing. She would like to know what Rand would make of the Aiel. It is going to be a long journey for everyone.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

The wagon holding their supplies is bouncing along the roads of a parched Tarabon. A few miles back they were attacked by brigands but the dust storm Nynaeve threw up helped them get away. Her anger has left her again so right now she can't channel. She's getting there again though. Just about everything she looks at annoys her.\nNynaeve climbs in the front of the wagon and tells Thom he can slow down now. Nynaeve is sickened by the display of affection Elayne shows for Thom. Thom replies that they may have lost the brigands but that there is other company approaching. A Whitecloak patrol is heading their way. Nynaeve puts on her best smile and talks to the leader.\nThe leader of the patrol wants to know who they are and what is going on in Tear. Nynaeve pretends to trade in dyes and says they are heading for Andor. She also claims to know nothing of any Aes Sedai involvement in the recent unrest in Tanchico. Simple merchants don't mingle with Aes Sedai. The captain seems to be convinced. Nynaeve wants to know if they are in Amadicia already. The Whitecloak replies that for now the border is five miles further. Elayne wants to know if the Whitecloaks mean to move it. Nynaeve quickly tries to smooth that comment over. The Whitecloak just says that Niall is sending food into Tarabon to keep the refugees out of Amadicia. After that he lets them go.\nWhen the Whitecloaks are out of earshot Nynaeve demands to know if Elayne thinks she is still in her mother's throne room. Thom breaks up the fight that ensues and to Nynaeve's disgust Elayne apologizes to Thom. They cross the Amadician border a bit later and approach the town of Mardecin. Nynaeve wants to get some supplies and get moving again but the other three think it is time for a days rest. Grudgingly Nynaeve agrees but an inn is out of the question. She tells Thom and Juilin to find a good campsite. They should have taken a ship.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

Of course not, it's the world around her. Elayne has gotten a bucket of water and she and Nynaeve freshen up a little. They discuss recent events in Tanchico and wonder if they were in fact the Aes Sedai the Whitecloaks mentioned. There is still a lot of tension between Elayne and Nynaeve. The conversation turns to Moghedien, something Juilin knows nothing about so the women discuss it very carefully.\nWhen Thom returns Nynaeve is disappointed at the food he has brought back. Thom says the town isn't prospering with trade to Tarabon drying up. It looks like Thom has ferreted out the state of local politics too but Nynaeve is not interested in that. She and Elayne decide to go into town for a bit to see if the can find fresh vegetables and to have a chance to talk. When Juilin flips a coin to see who will go with them Nynaeve points out they will be quite safe with so many Whitecloaks around.\nOn the way to the village Nynaeve confronts Elayne with her behaviour towards Thom. The girl is behaving very silly and it turns out to be a touchy subject. Rand is tangled in somehow. Elayne says she should have told him she loved him before he left. Nynaeve points out that he has Aviendha watching over him and that everything will be quite all right. Elayne also seems to know more about Thom's past. He must have been more than a gleeman once. But whatever it is she is not telling Nynaeve.\nThe town looks very dispirited to Nynaeve. They look around for fresh vegetables but nobody is selling anything worth that name. Nynaeve wonders how these people are going to make it through the winter. Then Nynaeve sees a sign above a seamstress' shop. A bundle of herbs signaling one of the Yellow Ajah's eyes-and-ears is active there. The sign is only used for the most pressing messages. Nynaeve wants to find out what the message is.\nThe shopkeeper, a graying woman named Ronde Macura, is very surprised when Nynaeve speaks the words to make herself known as Yellow Ajah. She sends her maid Luci to the kitchen immediately to make her best tea. Nynaeve nearly loses her patience with the babbling woman but she and Elayne end up in the kitchen with a cup of tea anyway. The tea has a minty flavor to it. Then Nynaeve finally manages to wring the message out of the woman: \"All sisters are welcome to return to the White Tower. The Tower must be whole and strong.\" Nynaeve waits for more but that is the whole message. Then the effect of the tea kicks in. They have been drugged. Before she loses consciousness Nynaeve manages to ask what was in the tea. She gets no answer of course."

Tharne makes her show her legs and they laugh at her modesty.\nMistress Tharne takes her to the back room, and we find from Siuan's thoughts that Siuan had run the Blue Ajah's eyes-and-ears before she'd been raised to Amyrlin Seat. Mistress Tharne had been an agent of the Blue Ajah since before Siuan had taken over.\nSiuan becomes angry with Mistress Tharne because of the way she has been treated.

It is carved with a \"wild bull collared with the Rose Crown of Andor\", a symbol of the House Bryne's loyalty to the Queen of Andor. He muses that this pipe is old and he needs a new one.\nGareth then recounts his experiences with Siuan Sanche. She and Elaida convinced Morgase to remove troops from the border of Murandy. Morgase gave him the order and he asked to speak with her privately. The Amyrlin \"jumped all over me. In front of half the court, she chewed me up one side and down the other like a raw recruit. Said if I couldn't do as I was told, she'd use me for fish bait.\"\nWith that, he gives the signal to head out.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

Nynaeve is in a foul mood because of an occurrence in the town of Bellon in Amadicia. The innkeeper offered a private room for Elayne or \"Lady Morelin\" and insisted that Nynaeve or \"Nana\" as the Lady's maid would be the only person who could serve her well enough. Nynaeve now only addresses Elayne as \"My Lady,\" much to Elayne's exasperation.\nElayne chastises Nynaeve for her attitude and they begin to talk about the strange message they received from Mistress Macura. Nynaeve declares that she will \"behave as thought the Black Ajah itself has control of the Tower,\" until they receive news to the contrary.\nThe coach is suddenly stopped by a traveling menagerie. Valan Luca, the owner of the menagerie offers to show them the wonders of his show. They spot \"giant boar-horses\" that Luca claims came from Shara, but both Elayne and Nynaeve know that they are Seanchan creatures, having seen them in Falme.\nHe says for a \"pittance\" he will have his show perform for them before he leaves for Ghealdan. Elayne declines and he admits that his boar-horses caused trouble in a nearby town, and the people of Sienda will not allow him to perform.\nElayne tells Nynaeve to give him some money and they continue on to Sienda. Elayne asks her how much she gave to Luca. Nynaeve had given him only a silver penny, which Elayne is not happy with, but decides to keep quiet rather than cause another fight.\nThey reach Sienda in the late afternoon, and could see where the boar-horse had caused trouble: at the inn called The King's Lancer. They note that there are many Whitecloaks and almost as many King's men wandering around the town, and they did not seem to get along.\nThey stop at The Light of Truth, apparently an inn the Whitecloaks frequent. They take a room, though Thom and Juilin have to sleep in the barn. The two men decide to see what they can learn in the common room and around town, and Nynaeve warns them not to disturb them for \"less than Trollocs\".\nIt is Nynaeve's turn with the ring. She quickly undresses and Elayne brings out the ter'angreal ring for her. Nynaeve lies down with the ring and Elayne settles down on a chest to wait.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

Nynaeve wonders how long it will be before Birgitte herself will be born again, but Birgitte tells her that time is quite different in Tel'aran'rhiod than in the real world and it could be years before she was born in the real world, while only weeks or months in Tel'aran'rhiod.\nNynaeve then questions her about the Forsaken. Lanfear, Rahvin, Sammael, Graendal, Demandred, and Semirhage have all been seen by Birgitte. Nynaeve is worried about Birgitte being seen, but Birgitte shrugs it off and says that each Forsaken has been \"stalking the others unseen.\" Nynaeve thinks they are plotting, but Birgitte does not know what they are up to, but that \"their work has never boded well for the world, waking or dreaming.\" Nynaeve wants her to continue trying to find out what they are up to, but not to take any risks.\nShe then asks Birgitte if she has seen Moghedien, but Birgitte has not. The archer reminds Nynaeve that Moghedien was not called the Spider for no reason; Moghedien could hide from Birgitte if the Forsaken knew that Birgitte was looking for her.\nBirgitte turns to leave and Nynaeve again asks her to let her tell Egwene and the Wise Ones about Birgitte. Birgitte refuses again and disappears.\nNynaeve is \"trying on\" dresses when Egwene comes upon her. Melaine the Wise One is with Egwene. Nynaeve immediately asks after Lan, and Egwene assures her that he is fine.\nNynaeve informs Egwene that they'd reached Amadicia, and about their encounter with Ronde Macura, though she leaves out the fact that Mistress Macura succeeded in capturing them. She instead claims that she was able to identify the forkroot immediately.\nEgwene then gives her the news from her side of the Dragonwall: Couladin crossing the Spine of the World and Rand eager to follow him. She also tells Nynaeve that Moiraine obeys Rand, which shocks Nynaeve, and she finds herself agreeing with Melaine that men have \"no business ordering Aes Sedai.\" Egwene comments on his swelled head, and Nynaeve reminds her how to reduce that swelling.\nThen Nynaeve tells Egwene that she thinks that the Forsaken are plotting something. Melaine asks if she has been \"wandering the World of Dreams\" and tells her that she is \"unschooled\". The Wise One does not believe Nynaeve should be in Tel'aran'rhiod. Nynaeve reminds her that she taught herself to channel and she can handle herself in Tel'aran'rhiod. Melaine suggests that Nynaeve go to the Wise Ones to learn, and praises Egwene for her swift learning. Nynaeve tells her that she does not need \"taming\". Melaine says that Lan will die if Nynaeve does, and Nynaeve calls her a \"dirty fighter\". Melaine maintains that she does not fight, and that Nynaeve should promise not to wander Tel'aran'rhiod. Nynaeve won't.\nMelaine and Egwene leave and Nynaeve goes to find out what is going on in the Tower.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

She disguises herself as an Accepted with Melaine's face.\nAs she starts out to the Amyrlin's study, she sees flashes of novices in white as they barely touch Tel'aran'rhiod. She approaches the Amyrlin's study and suddenly Elaida is in front of her, the Amyrlin's stole minus the blue stripe on her shoulders. Elaida chastises her and Nynaeve reflects that it is in Elaida's fondest dreams.\nWhen she enters the anteroom, she thinks that the fact that papers are left out on the table is odd of Leane. When she enters the Amyrlin's study, she realizes why she could not visualize herself there. It had been totally changed.\nThe door opens, and another Accepted comes in that Nynaeve does not recognize. She chastises Nynaeve for using Melaine's face and she realizes that it is Egwene. Egwene is angry at her for not being careful in Tel'aran'rhiod and vehemently warns her about the dangers of Tel'aran'rhiod.\nSuddenly, two men accost Nynaeve. She is terrified and cannot touch the Source. She begs Egwene to help her, and suddenly the creatures vanished. Egwene scolds her again and Nynaeve realizes that she has scratch marks on her chest and neck. Egwene tells her that because she has control of Tel'aran'rhiod, in some fashion, that she can make and unmake those creatures. She reminds Nynaeve that she can die here, and only through a figment of someone's imagination. Nynaeve says that she could always envision herself somewhere else. Egwene agrees dryly, but says she could only do it if she wasn't \"scared spitless\", which Nynaeve obviously was.\nTurning back to the Amyrlin's study, Nynaeve comments that none of it looks like Siuan Sanche. Egwene identifies the odd painting on the wall, the one next to the picture of Rand in the sky of Falme, as a triptych of Bonwhin, the last Red Amyrlin.\nEgwene orders Nynaeve to search through the papers on the Amyrlin's desk, and she goes to search through Leane's.\nNynaeve begins going through the papers and begins to read a report on a suspected Blue gathering when she hears Egwene cry out. Nynaeve goes to her aid and finds her just sitting at Leane's desk. Egwene tells her that Elaida is the Amyrlin Seat. At first Nynaeve doesn't believe it. She can't imagine Siuan Sanche dead and reflects that though she hated the woman, she respected her.\nEgwene tells her that the paper she saw was an arrest warrant for Moiraine Damodred, on the charge of treason. Nynaeve concludes that Elaida will not support Rand, and decides that this new information fits Mistress Macura's message for all loyal sisters to return to the Tower.\nNynaeve then tells Egwene about the message she started reading, and Egwene pushes her to remember it. Nynaeve is trying and then realizes that she's trying to please Egwene when it used to be the other way around. She found that her \"moral authority\" had vanished when she told her first lie to Egwene. She blurts out the truth to Egwene.\nEgwene suspected as much, since she'd never heard Nynaeve talk about forkroot, and tells her that she always tries to put the best face on everything. Nynaeve denies it and Egwene gets mad at her for lying to both Egwene and herself. She threatens Nynaeve with a vile herb concoction, the mixture that Nynaeve had made Egwene drink when Egwene had lied to her. Nynaeve admits that she does so, but protests that she only has ever lied about small things.\nEgwene relents and wants to decide who to tell. Moiraine and Rand, certainly, but she's not sure who else. She warns Nynaeve against telling anyone, and Nynaeve reminds her that she's \"not a fool\". Egwene agrees, except when she's in a temper. Egwene tells her to keep her wits about her and asks her again about the Blue gathering. Nynaeve cannot remember. Egwene tells her to be careful with Moghedien and vanishes. Nynaeve returns to her bed in Sienda."

She reflects that she's never seen Moiraine yell, and Moiraine is certainly quite effective.\nEgwene goes to Rand's tent, where Enaila and Aviendha sit outside. Enaila tells her that Rand is busy with Jasin Natael and is worried that he does not sleep enough. Aviendha is angry with him because she would like to sleep, but she cannot until Natael leaves.\nEgwene goes to Moiraine's tent and finds the Aes Sedai is still awake. Egwene is slightly surprised to find that Moiraine is eavesdropping on Rand since he shut the Wise Ones out of his dreams.\nEgwene tells Moiraine that Elaida is Amyrlin. Moiraine asks if her Talent as a Dreamer has manifested and Egwene makes it seem so to hide her being in Tel'aran'rhiod. She also tells Moiraine that she saw an arrest warrant for the older woman.\nMoiraine accepts it calmly, and Egwene is surprised that she does not grieve, even a little angry at it. Moiraine tells her that she and Siuan knew what they were doing, and knew the consequences. She tells Egwene that she \"has no time for tears.\"\nMoiraine also tells Egwene that she's not happy about what's happened, that she's not happy that the Tower has split apart. She says that she \"could almost wish that every sister had sworn to Elaida, whatever happened to Siuan.\"\nEgwene then asks about Rand and what will it mean for him and what Moiraine intends to do. Moiraine tells her that she will do her best with what she has and continue to try and help Rand.\nEgwene then tells her about the Forsaken. Both are concerned about Lanfear, who still loves Lews Therin/Rand. Moiraine says that they must keep an eye on them as much as possible, and hopes that they will not have to worry about Lanfear.\nEgwene is worried about what will happen if several Forsaken come at him at a time, but Moiraine reminds her that they must allow Rand to learn on his own. Egwene asks her why she has started doing as Rand says and the Aes Sedai tells her that she does so because she remembers how to control saidar. First, you must surrender to it. Moiraine then retires for the night.\nAs Egwene is returning to her tent, she realized that Moiraine spoke to her as an equal the entire time and reflects that she may be closer to the shawl than she thought."

Aviendha and Egwene are riding double on Mist. They approach Rand and tell him what happened in Taien is not his fault. Rand agrees. He didn't even know there was a town here until Rhuarc mentioned it a couple of days ago. Rand catches part of a conversation between them about him and thinks they are definitely spending too much time together.\nDismounting, Rand searches for Asmodean. He tells the Forsaken he is too tired for a \"discussion\" today. Rand tells him to go to his tent and expects to see him in the morning. Asmodean asks if Rand suddenly trusts him when he fails to ward Asmodean's tent. Rand says he trusts the man until he betrays him and that Rand will bury him the moment he does. He also says that it is Rand al'Thor speaking. He immediately regrets that last comment. No need to hint at the voice in his head in front of the Forsaken.\nHis tent is being put up by a number of gai'shain under Aviendha's direction. In the meantime, Rand sets a ward around the camp that will warn them if any Shadowspawn enters. The Aiel will have to watch for human enemies. Aviendha shows him a dangerous bloodsnake she killed with her belt knife. Rand tells her she shouldn't do dangerous things like that and should kill it with the Power. Aviendha replies that using the Power too often is just as dangerous.\nWhen they settle in the tent Aviendha offers him a sword, carefully wrapped in a blanket so she doesn't have to touch it. She hopes it will cancel the debt she owes him. Initially Rand wants to refuse the gift and says there is no debt. The sword is gaudy at best anyway. Until he notices the heron marks on the blade. It turns out this sword belonged to Laman, the treekiller, and the blade was made with the Power. The sheath and hilt he doesn't accept but he tells her the blade will cancel the debt. He will have another sheath and hilt made.\nOver dinner, which turns out to be stew containing the bloodsnake, they discuss Bael and Melaine's marriage. Rand is still unclear on Aiel customs concerning sister-wives and marriage in general. When they get ready for bed Rand asks what it means if a Maiden teaches a man to sing. Aviendha is amused by his question and guesses Rand is thinking of Mat. She tells him that sometimes a man will allow himself to be take gai'shain to be with a Maiden. The first thing these men, fools according to Aviendha, are taught is to sing. Aiel are strange people and the Maidens are the strangest of all. Rand sets a ward on his dreams and goes to sleep. He dreams of Min, Elayne and Aviendha and an Aiel wedding.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

Egwene still doesn't understand what is so important about them but Moiraine won't tell her. She can make out a couple of Maidens carrying dolls among the group guarding Rand. She tried to find out what that means but beyond a reminder the Maidens are not children nobody wants to tell her. Every time she thinks she understands Aiel ways something shows up to show she doesn't.\nCouladin left a grim reminder of his passage through the Pass behind. He razed the town of Selean to the ground, impaling many of the inhabitants. They found no survivors. Rand is surrounded by a group of clan chiefs and Wise Ones. He makes it clear that he means to save Cairhien, not ruin it. The Aiel can take the customary fifth, as long as it is not food, but no more than that. Rand will have anybody who takes more hanged. The clan chiefs don't understand why he takes pity on the treekillers but it looks like they will obey. Egwene approves of the order if only Rand wasn't so arrogant about it.\nEgwene offers Aviendha to ride with her for a bit. She wants to talk. Aviendha refuses to ride though so Egwene dismounts. Aviendha is still very upset with Rand. She is finally at the point where she asks Egwene to talk to the Wise Ones about not having to share his tent any more. Sorilea, the most strong willed Wise One Egwene has met so far, overhears them. She sends the other Wise Ones off so she can have a talk with Egwene and Aviendha.\nSorilea makes it very clear that Aviendha will obey the Wise Ones. Nobody will talk Aviendha out of doing her duty. She is disappointed to hear Rand didn't take an interest in Aviendha after all. She tells Aviendha she knows a suitable husband for her though. Aviendha meekly promises to look at him. Then Sorilea turns to Egwene and asks if Rand will hang even a clan chief if they break the rules he set. Egwene isn't sure but she thinks he might. She adds he can be made to see reason. Sorilea says she thinks he needs to be hard with them if he wants to lead them. She approves of the way he handled it. With that she leaves.\nAfter the Wise One is out of earshot Egwene offers to talk to the Wise Ones anyway but Aviendha says ji'e'toh requires she obeys. She says Egwene doesn't understand and she can't explain. Aviendha will not touch the subject any more.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

It's a collection of heroic and romantic tales. Not that she feels like reading much but tonight she is going to meet Nynaeve in the World of Dreams and it isn't night yet in Amadicia. Reading can't keep her awake though, she falls asleep with the book under her cheek.\nWith a start Egwene realizes she is in the Stone of Tear. She suspects she is fast asleep in the real world so she doesn't want to step out of the dream. She might not be able to return. To her surprise she sees Elayne in the Stone. She is talking to a woman who looks like Birgitte Silverbow. Before she can decide if it is her imagination Bair and Amys show up. They want to know if she decided to come early. Egwene explains about falling asleep. Luckily for her the Wise Ones believe her.\nThe Wise Ones are very displeased to see Elayne in the World of Dreams already. She is little more than an untrained child to them. Elayne points out she is not their pupil but is grateful for their concern nonetheless. Egwene wants to know why Elayne is here instead of Nynaeve. Elayne explains how Nynaeve got into a fight with one of the other members of the menagerie and is now nursing a sore head. Egwene is not amused and tells Elayne to tell Nynaeve to hold her temper. She also gives a hint that she wants to talk to Elayne alone later. Did the Daughter-Heir understand?\nThey quickly exchange news. Elayne isn't ready to leave the menagerie yet. Nynaeve still doesn't know where the Blues are gathering and they are learning a lot about the Seanchan from Cerandin. The Wise Ones don't understand their interest in the Seanchan. They fled after Rand defeated them at Falme. Elayne says that doesn't mean they won't come back. Egwene tells her they have moved into Cairhien with the Shaido still several days ahead heading for the capital. They have been spotted by the Cairhienin but that was unavoidable. When the exchange is complete Egwene watches the Wise Ones leave the World of Dreams to get some real sleep.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

When she is sure the Wise Ones took their own advice and went to sleep she forms an image of her novice room in the White Tower. Cautiously she looks into the corridor and sees the door of Elayne's room opening. She did get the message.\nEgwene wants to know about Birgitte but Elayne refuses to tell her anything. She made a promise not to. She asks Egwene to trust her on this. Reluctantly Egwene agrees. For now. Elayne wants to know how Rand is. Egwene tells her he is unhurt but that he is getting a bigger head every day. Elayne says she sees why he threatened the clan chiefs the way he did. He must be able to dispense justice without favors. But she agrees he needs to remember he is only a man too. Egwene asks if the fight Nynaeve got into won't cause problems. Elayne tells her Nynaeve apologized for it. Egwene once again stresses the message she gave Elayne earlier. Elayne notes Egwene has changed. She says Egwene will become Amyrlin Seat one day. With that she leaves.\nEgwene isn't ready to go yet though. She goes to Elaida's study to see if she can find out how things are in the Tower. Most of the reports speak of failure. Bashere's army is still missing, there are no reports from Tanchico. Niall is calling all Whitecloaks to Amador but no one knows why. Rand's location is unknown. The agent who let Elayne and Nynaeve escape is to be punished. It seems Elaida is making plans to build a palace as well.\nWhen Egwene moves into the Keeper's study she runs into Galad. He looks more beautiful than any man has the right to. He asks her to go with him for a walk but Leane interrupts them. Angry at herself for almost letting herself get caught in her own dream Egwene jumps to the Two Rivers. She runs into Galad again. They are married this time and he carries their son. From the corner of her eye she sees the red eagle and red wolf head banners. No, this isn't right. Screaming Egwene flees Tel'aran'rhiod."

It seems the depression experienced by gentled men has finally caught up with him. Min still sees the aura of glory around him though. With Logain not in the mood to do much of anything Siuan has regained the lead over the company. Siuan didn't think it was necessary to tell Min where exactly they are going.\nLeane has not given up on flirting and her tactics have succeeded in getting them shelter and lower bills in inns a number of times. It doesn't seem to help Logain though. Suddenly the woodlands they have been travelling through gives way to a village of surprising size. Min sees Warders and Aes Sedai with images flickering around them constantly. They don't seem to be particularly welcome in the village.\nSiuan leads them to a building that must have been an inn once. The inn shows signs of neglect and is decorated with old and mismatched furniture. Four Aes Sedai meet them there, Sheriam, Carlinya, Myrelle and Anaiya. Sheriam recognizes Min and asks what she was thinking bringing Logain here. She also wants to know how Min found them. Min tells them to ask Siuan and Leane. The four Aes Sedai seem to think such changes in appearance can be caused by stilling but still don't trust the two women claiming to be Siuan and Leane. They are put through a thorough questioning before the four Aes Sedai are satisfied they are indeed who they claim to be.\nSiuan now tells them she contacted one of her eyes and ears who also worked for the Blues and found out about Sallie Daera. Leane adds that even though they can't channel anymore they can still be of use to the Tower. Min and Logain are sent away while the others continue their conversation. Min is offered something to eat and several people come to talk to them but Min still doesn't get the feeling she is welcome in Salidar."

All the activity in the village is show, they have no purpose. They are waiting for Elaida to send someone to fetch them. This does not go down well with the Aes Sedai. It is pointed out to them that while they may have been Amyrlin and Keeper they are Aes Sedai no longer. The accusations brought against them were fabricated and the trial a mockery of justice but that doesn't mean they can start again where they left off.\nLeane and Siuan try to explain they can still be useful to the Tower. They can reroute the reports sent by the eyes and ears of their networks to Salidar. That would be a great advantage. They also have Logain who will testify that the Red Ajah set him up as false Dragon. Doing so Leane and Siuan reveal a lot about those networks that wasn't known to the Aes Sedai. With this new information returning to the Tower has become impossible. Siuan is outraged they would even consider that but the Tower must be strong at this time. That opportunity has passed though. Reluctantly they agree to use Siuan and Leane's contacts.\nAccording to the strategy Siuan and Leane worked out earlier Leane now puts another idea in the heads of the six Aes Sedai. Forming a Hall of Sitters and raising their own Amyrlin. This would mean the Tower would be broken for the world to see and that they have no other choice than to strive for Elaida's removal. The idea seems to take hold. Siuan also discusses the whereabouts of Rand with them. She thinks he is in the Aiel Waste and that a sister should be send to him before one of Elaida's can reach him. After some discussion it is agreed Kiruna and Bera should be sent to look for him. Siuan and Leane are about to be dismissed when Sheriam's Warder Arinvar arrives.\nHe reports some twenty armed men are approaching the village. Sheriam tells him they can't be allowed to give their presence away. Arinvar replies that both killing and capturing them would be difficult. They are veterans and they have even spotted the Warders. Sheriam tells him to do what he must to keep their location a secret. Before he can do so, however, Nuhel, one of Myrelle's Warders comes in and reports the group has halted and only one man is now approaching. He thinks it is Gareth Bryne. He also suggests they may have need for a general soon. Apparently the Warders are better informed of the situation than the Aes Sedai would like.\nSiuan can't hide her shock at Bryne following them all the way to Salidar. Sheriam notices she knows why Bryne is here. She orders Bryne brought to the inn to talk to the six and see if he can be brought into their service. In the mean time Siuan has no choice but to explain what he is doing in Salidar in the first place.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

The six Aes Sedai are introduced and Sheriam explains to him that they will see that the three honour their oath but that they can't go with him right that instant. Bryne says he'll be happy to wait for the Aes Sedai to finish with them. Sheriam then tells him who they really are.\nThe trap snaps shut. Since Bryne is going to stay with them a while they would be pleased if he could do them a favour. The chances of his men getting away are nonexistent with so many warders around. Bryne decides to state his conditions. It is obvious to him the Tower has split and that this group of Aes Sedai is vulnerable so close to Amadicia. If they need him they plan on raising an army and removing Elaida from power. He will recruit and lead their army under three conditions. First, he recruits, decides on promotions and leads the army. Second, they will heed him when he says something can't be done. Third, they will see it through to the end. If they decide to accept Elaida after all, it will cost him his head.\nWhile the Aes Sedai debate his terms Siuan wants to know what possessed him to follow them. It can't be for a barn. He replies it was for an oath but to himself he admits it's her blue eyes that drew him here. Siuan is not pleased and she gives him the rough side of her tongue. They argue a bit about an incident at the court in Caemlyn, the first and only time they met before Kore Springs. The Aes Sedai return and tell him they accept his conditions and pledge themselves to follow them without reservations. Bryne kneels and vows to serve them."

Most of the buildings have been damaged.\nRand managed to keep the Maidens out of the building he picked but of course that doesn't include Aviendha.

After that they make love.\nHours later Aviendha is getting dressed and marvels at the snow. She has never seen it before. Rand tells her they can get married as soon as they get back. What follows is a debate on different customs in the Two Rivers and the Aiel Waste but Aviendha will stick to hers. She will ask the man she wants to marry and marrying Rand is out of the question.

Asmodean? Or one of the other Forsaken?\nRand wants to release the damane but he can't touch the collars himself. He asks Aviendha to look at them. One of the Seanchan, Lady Morsa, recognizes Rand. She was at Falme. Rand warns her not to give him trouble or he will repeat that here. One of the other Seanchan, a Seeker for Truth named Jalindin, has some questions about Falme Lady Morsa would rather not answer. It looks like the Seeker for Truth is not going to let her get away though.\nAviendha has no luck releasing the damane and Rand sees the gateway getting smaller. They will have to leave now.

He tries to flirt with Nynaeve but she puts him off. After dinner they leave the dishes to the men and retire for another expedition into Tel'aran'rhiod. Before they go to sleep Elayne tells Nynaeve she shouldn't encourage Luca. Nynaeve protests she is only holding her temper but Elayne seems to think that is like trying to keep the sun from rising in the morning. It is Elayne's turn to visit the World of Dreams but Nynaeve insists she go. She has questions for Birgitte. Reluctantly Elayne agrees but she wants Nynaeve to ask Birgitte again to share the secret with Egwene.\nWhen Nynaeve meets Birgitte in the World of Dreams, the Hero of the Horn tells her she has found Moghedien. She can take Nynaeve for a brief look but she has to promise not to do anything. Five Forsaken are gathered, that is too much for Nynaeve to take on. Nynaeve agrees and the next moment she is spying on Graendal, Rahvin, Lanfear, Moghedien and Sammael. Sammael seems worried that 'he' will be at his throat. There is mention of a teacher too. Most of it seems quibbling. Birgitte takes them away again.\nBirgitte and Nynaeve are still discussing what they saw when Moghedien shows up. She throws Birgitte at the reflection of Nynaeve's wagon and knocks her out. Nynaeve finds she is shielded by the Forsaken. She tries to make Moghedien so angry she will kill her quickly but Moghedien seems to have other plans. Behind her Birgitte stirs. Nynaeve keeps Moghedien talking while Birgitte takes aim. She hits the Forsaken with one of her silver arrows but misses the heart. A wounded Moghedien flees and Nynaeve wakes up crying and thinking she has killed Birgitte."

She is heading for Samara where a number of them are gathering to look for them and gives the Black Sisters orders to follow as soon as they have seen to Liandrin.

Elayne's thoughts wander to the making of ter'angreal. Nynaeve wouldn't be happy if she knew Elayne considered making an a'dam. She thinks about her conversations with Thom about the Great Game too.\nSuddenly Nynaeve sits up in her bed, tears leaking from her eyes. Elayne considers waking her up but Nynaeve makes the choice for her. She cries and claims she has killed her. Before Elayne can figure out who Nynaeve is talking about Thom and Juilin knock on the door. Nynaeve wants to send them away but before Elayne gets the chance Thom pushes into the wagon with an unconscious and naked Birgitte in his arms. He says that she appeared out of nowhere and thinks she is dying.\nElayne tells the men she is a friend and works them out of the wagon again. Nynaeve, certainly angry enough to channel tries to Heal Birgitte. She weaves ever more intricate flows but she can't find anything wrong with the woman. Just that she is fading. Elayne tells Nynaeve to stop. She has an idea and wants to try it. She has only seen the weaves two times but she is sure she can do it. Before Nynaeve can ask what she has in mind Elayne weaves the flows to bind Birgitte to her as a Warder.\nThe benefits of the bond seem to be enough to save Birgitte. While Nynaeve doesn't like the idea of an Accepted bonding a female Warder she has to admit it works. The two women now discuss the implications of Birgitte being torn out of the World of Dreams. She can't be reborn in time to meet Gaidal now. How will this affect the Pattern? And what about Moghedien? Did she die? It seems unlikely. Birgitte missed the heart so the wound could have been Healed. That means the Forsaken probably has a good idea of where to look for them now. Of course with fifteen menageries in the area it won't be easy to find them. They still have some time to figure out how to get away. Nynaeve is still very upset and decides to go for a walk. Elayne decides Birgitte probably needs her more now and stays in the wagon to watch to sleeping woman.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

Nynaeve eventually returns from her walk, and she has obviously been crying. Nynaeve tells Elayne that she would like to watch Birgitte. \"You sleep. I will watch her. I have to watch her.\" Elayne stands up and goes outside for a walk, leaving the other two women alone.\nElayne finds Thom and Juilin outside by a small fire. Juilin hands a silver arrow to Elayne, saying that he found it when he and Thom discovered Birgitte. They seem to know who she is, though Elayne holds to her promise of not telling anyone about Birgitte. Juilin and Thom tell Elayne that Nynaeve was acting very distraught. She cried on Thom's shoulder and apologized for every cross word she has ever said to him.\nElayne decides that Thom and Juilin deserve to know at least some of what is going on. She tells them about Tel'aran'rhiod and Moghedien, the Black Ajah, and the Forsaken. She tells them that they may leave if they wish, but they both say that they will stay.\nElayne goes back into the wagon that she shares with Nynaeve. She manages to get Nynaeve to go to bed, and although Elayne had intended to stay up and watch Birgitte, she falls asleep too. When she awakens, it is to find that Birgitte is also awake. They speak for some time, and Birgitte decides to be Elayne's Warder and friend.\nThe next morning, Nynaeve is waiting on Birgitte hand and foot, since she still feels that it was her fault that Birgitte was pulled out of Tel'aran'rhiod. They leave their wagon and Birgitte ends up betting Valan Luca that she can out shoot him, one hundred crowns of gold to his one. She shoots four arrows at a target, the second two splitting the first two right down the shaft. Luca is delighted. He decides that instead of having Thom throw knives at Nynaeve during the show, he will have Birgitte shoot arrows at Nynaeve. Birgitte tells Luca to call her Maerion, since that was her name during one of her former lives.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

Nynaeve is holding her shawl tightly around herself, and Birgitte asks, \"If you are going to wear the dress, why cover up?\" Birgitte confronts Nynaeve about how she is waiting hand and foot on Birgitte, and Nynaeve tries to explain that everything is all her fault. Birgitte argues that she made her own decisions, and that Nynaeve is trying to make her less by claiming responsibility. Birgitte tells Nynaeve that she used to like her, but that she no longer does with Nynaeve acting the way she does.\nAfter this exchange, they separate. Nynaeve begins to walk through the circus, watching as everyone gets ready for the show. She sees Thom, juggling and eating fire. She also sees a man with a topknot who looks familiar, but she is not paying much attention to him. Finally, she reaches the high rope. She and Luca watch as Juilin staggers forward, looking drunk. He approaches the ladder, and stares up at one of the platforms. With some people urging him on and Luca trying to talk him out of it, Juilin sets a mug down on the ground and begins to climb the ladder. He reaches the platform, swaying back and forth. He reaches out one foot the rope, and then jerks it back, thinks, and then gets an idea. He proceeds to crawl out onto the rope. The whole time, the crowd is roaring with laughter, and Luca is trying to convince him to come back down. Halfway across the rope, Juilin stops. He falls, but catches himself on the rope with one hand and a knee. He then makes his way, hand over hand, to the other platform. Once there, he looks back and seems to realize that he left his drink on the other side. This time, he walks smoothly across the rope and slides down the ladder. Everyone then realizes that it was all an act. The crowd loves it.\nElayne appears and stops next to Juilin. She is dressed in white breeches and a jacket, both of which have sequins on them. She goes up the ladder, and the crowd applauds. Elayne walks across the rope. Whereas she used to weave a platform of air while practising, Nynaeve knows that this time, she is actually walking across the rope. When she gets to the other platform, she gets even more applause than Juilin did. Going back, she pivots on the rope a few times. She nearly falls once, but manages to make it back to the platform. Next, she cartwheels along the rope. She does some more pivots and a back flip, and one more round of cartwheels before she finishes.\nWhen she gets back to the ground, the crowd rushes towards Elayne. The man with the topknot, who also only has one eye, turns and walks away, muttering something under his breath. Nynaeve suddenly recognizes him and hurries after him.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

Uno and Ragan are forced to give up their weapons before entering.\nOnce they are inside, they are stopped and told that the Prophet is busy. He is speaking to a woman who is wearing a lot of jewelry. Nynaeve is surprised by their exchange, which is about law in Ghealdan. The woman hands all of her jewelry over to Masema. Nynaeve is told that every penny goes to the poor.\nWhen the woman leaves, Nynaeve, Uno and Ragan are admitted. Masema is disapproving of Nynaeve's appearance. Uno quickly introduces her. \"This is Nynaeve al'Meara. From Emond's Field, in the Two Rivers, whence the Lord Dragon comes. She was at Fal Dara with the Lord Dragon, and at Falme. The Lord Dragon rescued her at Falme. The Lord Dragon cares for her as for a mother.\" Masema recognizes her and is ecstatic; he says that Nynaeve can help him, can relate to people the first words of wisdom of the Lord Dragon, and the miracles that accompanied his childhood. Nynaeve cautiously replies that the Lord Dragon has summoned her to Tear, and that she needs a riverboat in order to reach him. Masema reluctantly agrees to help her.\nOnce Nynaeve, Uno and Ragan leave, the two Shienarans tell Nynaeve about what has been happening in Ghealdan since Masema arrived. Nynaeve learns that the woman who had been speaking to Masema was Alliandre, the Queen of Ghealdan. At first, she thinks that Alliandre is doing a horrible job as queen, submitting so easily to the Prophet. Uno and Ragan tell her that there have been four monarchs on the throne. Johanin thought that Masema was a harmless mad man and did nothing about the crowds growing in Ghealdan. He died in a \"hunting accident\". Ellizelle, who succeeded him, tried to disperse the crowds; she was poisoned. Teresia replaced her, and after she sent soldiers against folk who had gathered to hear Masema, she supposedly abdicated to marry a rich merchant, though she, of course, had no choice. Alliandre is the fourth ruler in the past year, and immediately upon gaining the throne, informed Masema that he would not be troubled again. It is only by submitting to the Prophet that she keeps her life and her throne.\nIt is then that they realize there is a Whitecloak following them. Nynaeve tells Uno and Ragan to take the next turn so that she can get a look at his face. It is Galad.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

Galad replies that he had had orders for Salidar, but that changed because of the Prophet. As soon as Galad says the name \"Salidar\", something clicks in Nynaeve's mind.\nGalad tells Nynaeve that he has been sick with worry for her and Elayne. He informs her that he will find passage for her and Elayne to Altara, and Nynaeve is stunned. Galad tells her that it is all he can do, now, since his duty is there in Ghealdan. He asks where she and Elayne are staying so that he can get a hold of them when he finds a ship, but Nynaeve is reluctant to tell him. Galad swears on his mother's name that he will let no harm come to them. Nynaeve finally tells him that they are with Valan Luca's show, and Galad is shocked. He wants to buy them a room in town, but Nynaeve refuses, saying that it would attract too much attention if a Whitecloak were to go to any amount of trouble to secure a room for two women. Galad finally agrees.\nNynaeve, Uno and Ragan take off and head back to Valan Luca's show. Along the way, Nynaeve decides that having Uno and Ragan around could be rather helpful.

She tells them that one of them will come each day to check in with her, but that they will otherwise stay away, so as not to attract attention, unless a riverboat arrives.

Meanwhile, Elayne is talking about Galad; she says that Galad will hold to his oath, and that they can trust him, though she does not sound as if she particularly likes it.\nBirgitte refuses to do the show in the morning, when Nynaeve says that the light will be better. Nynaeve is positioned against a rough wooden fence. She is thinking about how she is now facing punishment for taking so many fool risks, when out of nowhere, an arrow embeds itself into the wood next to her. Her resolve breaks with a wail.

The Cairhienin and Tairen forces are under the command of the Tairen Lord Weiramon.

Caught up in the military planning Mat replies without thinking.\nHe says no for two reasons. First they might push the Shaido over the city wall into Cairhien. That would surely mean a bloody battle inside the city. The best thing to do is to try and shove them away. With the right positioning of forces they can push Couladin across the river.

West again, instead of south, the direction he wants to take. Next time he stops to look around he sees a group of Tairen and Cairhienin men. Through the looking glass he won from Kin Tovere he also sees Aiel approaching, these are definitely Couladin's. But the Cairhienin and Tairens can't see them yet. It is obvious to Mat that they won't until it is too late.\nCalling himself a fool he rides towards the Tairens to warn them. Before he knows it he is giving orders in the name of the Lord Dragon. The tells the horsemen to divide in several groups and asks the Cairhienin if they can form the formation called hedgehog and gets Talmanes, the leader of the Cairhienin cavalry to agree to his plan, though he only does so on condition that Mat leads half the horse. Especially the Tairens are insulted but Mat's insistence that their cavalry will not stand a chance against the Aiel but in the end they do as he tells them.\nWhen the battle breaks loose some of them decide to follow their own plan anyway and die because of it but most of the group sticks to the plan. He sees the leader of the Tairen horsemen go down though. Good riddance. Mat throws the group of horsemen he held back with him into the battle. The Aiel never see them coming until it is too late. Then the lightning begins to fall and things get really hairy.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

Egwene and Aviendha have taken to channeling in turns to give each other the chance to rest. Rand has no one to share the burden with. Rand sees bands of Aiel fighting everywhere. Mostly they are too closely meshed for him to do anything about it. He has seen the column of Tairen and Cairhienin fighting Aiel a number of times. Appointing Melanril after sending Weiramon to Tear to deal with the Illianers proves to be a mistake. Nothing Rand can do about it now.\nOutside the city Rand can see the Cairhienin decided to make a sortie. They are not getting very far though. Rand channels to prevent the Shaido from entering the city. How many of his own did he kill in that action? Rand feels another man channeling. Asmodean is tempted even from his tent it seems. Bolts of lightning plow through the Maidens and hit the base of the observation tower. It slowly slants over. Rand manages to grab Egwene and Aviendha before the tower comes crashing down and Rand loses consciousness.\nWhen he wakes up Aviendha and Egwene are with him. Both look severely shaken but not seriously injured. With them not holding the clouds anymore rain is starting to come down. Rand now realizes Sammael is responsible for this attack. The Maidens have not escaped the destruction either. Many have been killed or are wounded. So much for keeping them safe. His first impulse is to go after Sammael but Aviendha and Egwene talk him out of that. He has other responsibilities today. A messenger comes in saying the four clans who have not chosen sides yet are on the move. He tells the messenger to tell Han to keep them off their backs. Not that the clan chief needs to be told what to do.\nIf he is going to be of any use in the battle he will have to get closer to the fighting. He calls for his horse and tells Sulin he needs a guard. He gives strict orders to make sure the wounded stay behind and to make sure that they are well guarded. If he had his way all the Maidens would stay behind but that is not going to happen it seems. He has trouble mounting his horse and Egwene comments on that. She has had similar trouble getting in the saddle so Rand suggests she lets Sorilea check her out. That certainly makes her close her mouth."

He should be able to see Rand's observation tower from here but he can't find it. He should leave the soldiers and move south again. He should but Mat keeps studying the terrain.\nEstaen, Nalesean, Daerid and Talmanes ride up to him. Another group of Aiel is approaching. They are heading straight for them and it seems Couladin himself is with this band. Mat would like to avoid another battle but like the previous battles it is catch or be caught.\nMat gives the orders. He will have the horsemen outflank the Aiel. There is no question about who is in charge anymore. He has kept them alive so far. The men have confidence in him. Mat decides to stay with the pikemen this time. When he takes his place Daerid asks him if he means to slay Couladin himself. Daerid respects him as a soldier, some day he would like to hear Mat's story, but he knows young blood is hot. Mat tells him he can keep his head and tries to convince himself that is not the reason why he stayed with the pikes this time. Mat tells them to raise the cry 'Protect the Lord Dragon' as soon as the Aiel are in sight. That should keep their attention fixed on the infantry. It is a big gamble, the biggest Mat has taken so far. The dice rattle in his head."

She's been having nightmares for the past days - about Moghedien, the prophet, Birgitte shooting arrows at her and not missing, and of Elaida being in charge in Salidar. She has also dreamed of Egwene and is confused as to why Egwene has been appearing in so many of her dreams. Nynaeve receives new clothes from Valan Luca, cut low and in bright colors. She is upset about having to wear them.\nElayne is in the wagon with Nynaeve. There has been tension between the two of them for the past three days, and they have been quarrelling a lot.\nElayne tells Nynaeve that she has been dreaming about Egwene as well. After comparing their dreams, they realize that they have both had the same dreams, and that, through the dreams, Egwene has been talking to them and updating them on Rand's victory in Cairhien.\nElayne convinces Nynaeve to use the ter'angreal ring to visit the Heart of the Stone in Tel'aran'rhiod in an attempt to try to meet with Egwene. Nynaeve is afraid to use it after her encounter with Moghedien in Tel'aran'rhiod.\nBirgitte enters the wagon without knocking, and surprises Nynaeve, who in turn snaps at her. Birgitte snaps back and it takes Elayne to stop the two from quarrelling further.\nBirgitte tells Elayne and Nynaeve that Thom and Juilin are back from Samara. Elayne and Nynaeve get upset since Thom and Juilin swore to obey them and they were not given permission to go, and no one would have known if anything happened to them.\nElayne, Nynaeve and Birgitte go to question Thom and Juilin. Both men are hurt and Thom is bleeding from a cut in his scalp. Elayne forgets her anger when she sees Thom and runs over to him to tend his wound. Nynaeve refuses to use Healing on the men, even though she is angry enough to channel.\nThom tells the girls that, \"Samara's a school of silverpike around a chunk of bloody meat. There are mobs on every street hunting Darkfriends and anybody else who isn't ready to hail the Prophet as the one true voice of the Dragon Reborn.\"\nUno comes through the wagons to tell Elayne and Nynaeve that he has found a ship for them, but that it's going to be near impossible to get to it because of the riots in town. Nynaeve tells Uno that, nevertheless, she expects him to keep his word about getting to the ship. Elayne tries to flatter Uno and reminds him of the Shienaran's bravery and fighting skills. Birgitte gives Uno a back massage. Uno agrees to take them to the ship but tells them that there is fighting on the docks between the Prophet's men and the Whitecloaks, and that this is what started the riots in Samara.\nNynaeve realizes that she might have caused this by asking Galad to find a ship.\nGalad comes to tell Nynaeve that he kept his word and secured a ship for them. He has paid for their passage on it, and the Whitecloaks are now holding it until they can get to it. Nynaeve is upset at Galad for not realizing the consequences of his actions and the riots it caused. Galad doesn't understand why Nynaeve is upset. His only thought is that he gave his word and kept it.\nValan Luca arrives, battered as well, and tells everyone that they are leaving Samara within the hour. Nynaeve tells Luca that they are not continuing with the circus and offers him the rest of the money she promised him. Luca refuses the money and asks Nynaeve to stay, telling her that he wants her to marry him and have his children. Nynaeve declines his offer, telling him that she is betrothed to another man. Luca agrees to let her leave but tells her that she is the only one for him, that he will find her again, and that she will choose him over Lan."

She packs the twisted stone ring, Lan's signet ring, her gold Great Serpent ring, the gems Amathera gave to her, some pouches of herbs and a small mortar and pestle to prepare them, and finally the letters-of-rights and three of the six purses. She also takes one of the letters that authorize the bearer to do whatever she wishes in the name of the Amyrlin. She decides to leave the a'dam and the box containing the other Dreamworld ter'angreal to Elayne. She also packs most of her clothes, but regrets having to leave some behind. She uses Luca's red dress to pack the Dark One's Seal; she can't bring herself to touch it because of the evil feeling coming from it.\nElayne comes in looking very upset. She packs the a'dam, Birgitte's silver arrow, the other two Dreamworld ter'angreal (sleeping woman amber plaque and the iron disc) and the rest of the money. Elayne also manages to pack all of her clothes and belongings, leaving almost nothing behind. The tension is high between Elayne and Nynaeve.\nOutside, the men have already packed everything and they are ready to go. Birgitte is outside, also ready to go.\nThe people from the circus come to wish them all goodbye; some offer to escort them to the city but they are relieved when their offer is denied. Luca gives Nynaeve flowers and professes his undying love to her, embarrassing her and making her furious at both him and Lan.\nThe group head out for Samara, with Galad leading, flanked by Thom and Juilin, and the Shienarans in a long file to either side. The women walk in the middle. The men are all very nervous and keep fiddling with their weapons. However, the walk to the town is uneventful.\nWhen they reach Samara they are greeted by the sight of burning houses, corpses hanging from various places and bodies on the ground. The only sounds are glass shards breaking under their feet and the buzz of the faraway mobs.\nThe group runs into one of the mobs and has to fight their way to the docks. The men manage to hold the mob, but it is Galad who finally breaks through them. Thom, Juilin and most of the Shienarans are wounded. Galad is untouched. When they reach the docks Galad speaks to the Whitecloaks and they let the group in.\nA small crowd is huddled near the docks, under white-cloaked guards; nearly a dozen men, old, ragged and bruised, and twice as many women, most with children and babies. The sight wrenches Nynaeve's heart. She makes the captain, Neres, agree to take them on his ship as well.\nGalad tells Nynaeve and Elayne that he only paid for half the travel costs (as far as Boannda) because Captain Neres over-charged the traveling fee and he doesn't have enough money to pay for the entire trip.\nNynaeve thanks Galad for his efforts; she still can't understand how he could have started a war in Samara to keep a promise.\nGalad tells Nynaeve and Elayne to stay away from Rand. Nynaeve wonders if Galad suspects that they have no intention of going to Caemlyn, but dismisses the idea.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

Captain Neres leaves his cabin to Nynaeve and Elayne; Thom, Juilin and Uno seem to have \"persuaded\" him to do so. The boat is terribly crowded because of the refugees. Elayne voices her suspicion that Captain Neres is a smuggler because he only wanted to travel by night. Elayne and Nynaeve blackmail Neres into emptying his hold so that the refugees have a place to stay. Nynaeve contemplates about Neres' dislike of women. He seems to think that they only cause trouble.\nThom, Juilin and Uno start \"tormenting Neres with darkly smiling comments about cracking heads and slitting throats.\" Nynaeve wants to give them a tongue-lashing but cannot because she never gets them alone.\nNynaeve finds out that Elayne channeled favorable winds. At first she is mad that Elayne channeled without asking her. Elayne argues that Samara is far enough behind them, and that Moghedien could not have located where the channeling came from. Nynaeve is relieved that the trip on the boat will be shortened by Elayne's channeling, but she has trouble admitting it. The two of them fight with smiling faces so as to not raise suspicion. Birgitte has to threaten them to make them stop. The men on board think that they must be happy to have left Samara. The women, however, seem to realize the masquerade and stay clear of the three.\nDay by day the atmosphere becomes more friendly. Nynaeve starts Healing people. She tries to hide the fact that she channels by using herbs and ointments. Elayne and Birgitte follow her example and start playing and having fun with the refugees' children. Elayne continues to study the a'dam in the privacy of her cabin.\nThe refugees tell their stories and Nynaeve and Elayne let a coin slip here and there. The men seem to have lost hope over what happened to them, but Nynaeve admires the women. They have lost as much as the men, but having children does not allow them to lose hope. Nynaeve becomes fond of three women especially, because all of them remind her of a certain aspect of her own life. Nicola had been engaged but Hyran, her fiance, became a Dragonsworn following the Prophet until he was killed. She wanted to get as far away from the Prophet as she could. Marigan was a mother of two, Jaril and Seve, who had been dealing in cures and herbs, which was a dangerous business so close to Amadicia and the Whitecloaks. She had had to flee after she had healed a man from a fever and people started to say that she had brought him back from the dead. Areina had traveled to Illian to keep her younger brother, Gwil, from taking the oath as a Hunter of the Horn. She ended up taking the oath herself, traveling the world in the hope of finding her brother somewhere and bringing him back home. She had a hard time traveling but didn't intend to let that stop her.\nBirgitte learns that Elayne is the Daughter-Heir of Andor. Elayne and Birgitte wash the black dye out of their hair. After seeing Birgitte's blond braid, Neres mutters something about \"Birgitte stepping out of the bloody stories.\"\nWhenever Neres looks longingly at a place where he could stop and hide during the day, Nynaeve mentions how glad he must be to soon get the people from Samara off his boat.\nWhen the boat reaches Boannda, most of the Samarans leave the Riverserpent. Nicola, Marigan and Areina want to keep traveling with Nynaeve. Elayne and Birgitte agree. Nynaeve convinces Neres to take them as far as Salidar. He has to accept Nynaeve's conditions since he needs to avoid dealing with the authorities in Boannda and since he needs to travel south anyway.\nNynaeve remembers a trip to Tel'aran'rhiod during their first night on the Riverserpent. She stood in the Heart of the Stone in Tear calling Egwene's name, terrified to death that Moghedien might be there or might be watching her. When she comes back to the waking world, she breaks down and cries, feeling like coward. Elayne and Birgitte try to convince her that she is not a coward. Elayne and Nynaeve go back to Tel'aran'rhiod.\nThey start at the Stone of Tear, go to the Royal Palace in Caemlyn, to Emond's Field and to Elaida's Study in the White Tower. Nynaeve sees the changes in Emond's Field and wonders what the banners and the new buildings mean. Going through the documents on Elaida's and the Keeper's table, they learn that Elaida knows that Rand has crossed the Dragonwall into Cairhien and other things that are of no immediate importance. They return. Nynaeve is glad that she went back to the World of Dreams, almost forgetting about her fears. They take more trips and practice control of the World of Dreams.\nThey meet with Egwene and Amys. Egwene tells them everything that has happened since the last time they saw each other. She even tells them things that she had told them before, when she had been talking to Elayne and Nynaeve in their dreams when the Wise Ones had forbidden her to dreamwalk, so as not to let Amys know that she had disobeyed the Wise Ones. Egwene and Amys report what Rand has been up to. Egwene asks whether Nynaeve and the others are still with Valan Luca. They tell their story.\nEgwene hints at meeting the two in Sheriam's study afterwards. When Egwene sees Nynaeve and Elayne there she furiously tells them not to reveal her secret visits to Tel'aran'rhiod.\nAfter five days of travel they reach a beach close to Salidar. Nothing along the shore hints at a village existing near-by. The small party starts their way inland.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

But they are harshly interrogated by six Aes Sedai (Sheriam, Morvrin, Myrelle, Carlinya, Anaiya and Beonin). They tell the story they had agreed on telling and manage to keep most of their secrets. They hide details about their encounter with Moghedien and they also manage to keep the secret of Birgitte's real identity. Additionally the Aes Sedai don't find out that Nynaeve and Elayne have been posing as full sisters.\nNynaeve is surprised to find Siuan and Leane alive. She senses a chill between the two women. She is also aware of them being stilled. She feels the lack of something and describes that it feels almost like a wound. She becomes curious and plans to find out whether that wound can be healed. Nynaeve also feels the lack of freedom. She finds it hard to readjust to others being in charge. When she jumps to please Sheriam she realizes that their \"days of freedom certainly were gone\".\nThe Aes Sedai question them about Birgitte's silver bow, the a'dam and most importantly about Tel'aran'rhiod and the dream ter'angreal. Siuan is questioned as to why she gave a letter with her seal to Accepted and why she sent them after the Black Ajah. But the Aes Sedai are most intent on using the dream ter'angreal to spy on Elaida and to contact Moiraine through Egwene. Sheriam orders Nynaeve and Elayne to teach the Aes Sedai the use of the ter'angreal. Nynaeve fears that once they know how to use it that it would probably be taken away from them.\nThe Aes Sedai agree that Nynaeve and Elayne left the Tower by command and that they cannot be blamed for it. They are to resume their studies.\nBefore the interrogation is over, Beonin brings the topic back to the seal on the Dark One's prison that was in Nynaeve and Elayne's possession. It is shattered, even though it is made of cuendillar. Elayne says that they didn't take care of it because they didn't think they would have to, given the fact that cuendillar is indestructible. Anaiya says that, if her information is correct, three seals still hold.\nAfter the interrogation, Nynaeve goes to the common room where Thom, Juilin and Uno try to convince them to flee from Salidar. Nynaeve thinks about the advantages she would have from being able to study with the Aes Sedai of the Yellow Ajah in Salidar (Therva Maresis, Nisao Dachen, Dagdara Finchey). Elayne also says that she would like to stay in Salidar. The two of them urge Thom, Juilin and Uno to ride to Cairhien without them to help Rand. Suddenly all three of them find reasons why they'd like to stay in Salidar, obviously wanting to protect the girls.\nBirgitte and Min play with Marigan's boys, Jaril and Seve. Nynaeve and Elayne reassure Birgitte that they were able to keep her secret. Two of Myrelle's Warders, Croi Makin and Avar Hachami, are the only people in the common room not scurrying around on some errand. They seem to be in a conversation but were probably assigned to watch the newcomers.\nFaolain comes in and orders Areina and Nicola to be tested to see if they can channel.\nSiuan and Leane come out of the room where the interrogation had been held. Iciness still surrounds them, but Nynaeve sees a small flicker of sympathy. Siuan joins the newcomers. Her face goes blank when Gareth Bryne joins the small group. He asks Uno for help in training his army. He also talks to Thom. To Nynaeve it sounds like riddles, but the reader understands that they talk about their past and that Thom assures Gareth Bryne of his support as long as it doesn't tie him to the situation for too long. Gareth Bryne almost ignores Elayne.\nSiuan takes Nynaeve to a room where she demands that Nynaeve also teaches her the use of the dream ter'angreal. If she doesn't, she will reveal that they had posed as full sisters. Nynaeve doesn't want to be bullied. She threatens Siuan to reveal that she and Leane are not as hostile to each other as they pretend to be. Her hunch had been right, their hostility is a masquerade. Nynaeve still agrees to teach Siuan if she allows her to study her and Leane's stilling, and Logain's gentling."

Elayne wants to talk about the viewing Min had about Rand and her and about Elayne having to share him. Min says that she'll have to share him with two others. She also admits that she is one of those two. Elayne is shocked. She admits that she doesn't like the thought of having to share him. So does Min, saying, \"Elayne, it shames me to admit it, but I will take him any way I can get him.\" However, both agree that they like each other. They wonder who the third woman will be.

The latest pretty young woman Lady Colavaere has been trying to get into his bed since he arrived in Cairhien ten days ago. Rand is getting very tired of the everlasting game of houses being played in Cairhien. He scares Selande off with talk of the male half of the source.\nDeciding that this is no better than waiting inside Rand returns to his company. A number of Cairhienin and Tairen lords and ladies are awaiting him. All plotting to take over the throne or carve out their own kingdoms as soon as his back is turned. He has received news that Berelain, the first of Mayene is coming to Cairhien. Maybe he should put her in charge here so he can move against Sammael in Illian.\nHe makes sure the Tairen lords know he is aware of their attempts to keep their soldiers in Cairhien and that he expects them to be on the move as he ordered. He also invites Lady Colavaere to a private dinner tonight to stop her from sending any more women to him. He doesn't want Aviendha to repeat what she had done to the one she caught. Then he dismisses the party.\nAfter they have left Moiraine, Egwene and Aviendha come to see him. Rand is still upset with Egwene's refusal to give him more information about the mysterious Aes Sedai that may come to his aid. Moiraine hands him two letters, both with the seal of Tar Valon on them. The first is from the new Amyrlin Elaida, telling him there is a delegation on its way to take him back to Tar Valon so the Tower can see to his safety until Tarmon Gai'don. The second is from Elaida's keeper Alviarin. It's a lot more polite than Elaida's and a warning of sorts.\nRand lets the women read both letters even though Alviarin tells him not to let anyone, even Moiraine see hers. They discuss the content. It is obvious Tar Valon has spies in Cairhien. And there seems to be a division in the Tower Elaida may be unaware of. Right now there is not a whole lot Rand can do about it though. Except for keeping Elaida's 'delegation' at a safe distance.\nThe Aiel guard announce Mat has arrived to see Rand. He asks the women to stay, it might unbalance Mat enough to get him to do what Rand wants of him. Moiraine asks Mat about his military activities over the past few days. Mat has been involved in a number of battles with the Andorans who have moved into the west of Cairhien. He and his Band of the Red Hand emerged victorious. She wonders if Mat finds battles or if the battles find Mat though. Mat feels attacked by this but the conversation turns in another direction when he reveals he has news that concerns Elayne.\nMat thinks Morgase, Queen of Andor is dead. The rumours among the Andorans point in that direction at least. Gaebril/Rahvin is king of Andor now. The first in the existence of the nation. Rand is furious about this news. He waited too long to remove Rahvin and now Elayne's mother is dead. Will she ever forgive him for that? At least he can still avenge her death. Rand is ready to leave for Caemlyn now. To his surprise Moiraine doesn't try to stop him. She just tells him to do it tomorrow. Rand sees she is right. After some discussion he allows the three women to accompany him. Who is to say only Rahvin will be in Caemlyn after all. When that is decided he asks the women to leave. Mat stays behind and Rand starts making it very clear he needs Mat's newfound military knowledge and how Mat is going to use it."

None of them tried to talk him out of it, they seemed to think of it in terms of ji'e'toh. The Wise Ones didn't argue with him either, they just made it very clear that his obligation to Elayne didn't outweigh his obligation to the Aiel.\nAviendha mentions Lady Colavaere came to see him last night. Rand forgot all about that. Aviendha says they had a talk and that he won't be bothered by women sent to him by Lady Colaveare. She also says that the Lady would be able to hide the evidence. Not the methods which Rand would have chosen but it will work.\nAsmodean comes in, he asks permission to join Rand on his trip. Originally the plan was for him to stay behind. Rand reluctantly agrees. Mat comes to see Rand as well. He tells how Melindhra attacked him and that he had to kill her. Now that the Forsaken have noticed him he wants to join Rand too.\nMoiraine and Egwene appear.

Sorilea and the other Wise Ones push their way through the crowds to reach them. They say Egwene will be fine but that she needs rest. She won't go to Caemlyn with him and she won't visit the World of Dreams for a while either.\nRand turns back to Lan and tries to apologize for not saving Moiraine. Lan says Moiraine was as much a soldier as he was and that she accepted the risk. Rand asks Lan if he wants to stay around but the Warder explains Moiraine did something to his bond that forces him to find his new Aes Sedai. He has to go. Lan tells Rand that if he sees Nynaeve he should tell her Lan found someone else. He also tells Rand that if he ever loves a woman he should leave her. That is the best thing he can do for her. With that the Warder leaves.\nRand now takes the time to read the letter Moiraine gave him. It explains Moiraine has known this moment was coming since her visit to Rhuidean. The alternatives were Rand dying or Rand becoming Lanfear's devoted lover. Either was unacceptable. She also knew he might not be able to kill a woman. She leaves a few final warnings for him. One is to tell Lan that what she did was for the best. The second is not to trust any Aes Sedai and last is not to trust 'Natael'. Apparently she found out who he was. It also asks him to deliver the second letter to Thom.\nRand is still contemplating the content of the letter when Sulin approaches him. She is very upset with him for not allowing any Maidens to come with him to Caemlyn. In very blunt terms she explains to Rand that the spear is what she is and that he nor any other man has the right to try to change her. If Rand will not allow the Maidens to carry his honour she'd rather die. Rand explains his reluctance to send women into battle to her but it doesn't seem to impress the Maiden. Rand remarks she doesn't leave him much of a choice. Sulin replies ji'e'toh always leaves you a choice. Rand suppresses his anger at the, in his eyes, ridiculous demands of ji'e'toh and tells Sulin he will allow as many Maidens as the members of the other societies are taking. Satisfied Sulin leaves to gather them.\nMat joins Rand and looks at the Maiden leaving. Rand wants to know why he seems so cheerful. Mat answers that he is because he is alive.

The Saldaean general has been sent on a mission by his queen to make sure the false Dragon Taim doesn't bother Saldaea anymore. He left his army north of the border of Andor and went to see Morgase but was ignored by Gaebril. Now he hears Morgase may be dead. Rand tells them that both Morgase and Gaebril are dead.\nHe also explains to Bashere that he can't have Taim. Rand wasn't planning on revealing this so soon but he plans on giving any man who can channel amnesty. Why should a man be hunted down because he can do what Rand can? With the Last Battle coming they will need every one of them.\nBashere notes he has conquered Tear, got the support of the Aiel, rules in Cairhien and now in Caemlyn too. Will Rand go on to conquer the world? Rand tells him he will if he must. Humanity cannot be allowed to keep fighting its own petty battles with the Last Battle on the horizon. He'd welcome any ruler who would ally with him but so far he's only encountered hostility. Bashere can't speak for the borderlands or even Saldaea but he tells Rand the Borderlands will come to his banner. He offers his service and that of nine thousand Saldaean horses."

Mat dances a dance from his memories with a serving girl, Betse, to impress her, but blows it by assuming she will be available when he next wants her. He inspects his men at the various inns in the town, which is also full of Hunters and refugees, who he is feeding. The men are singing a song Mat taught them, about how bad a soldier's life is, which serves as a recruiting aid. He thinks on a nervous visit Rand paid and wonders about his sanity. He comes across two Hunters threatening an ugly boy, Olver, for sitting on a horse and beats them for it and tells them to get out of town. After learning Olver's family is dead, Mat decides to look after him. The Band moves South at first light, under the structure Mat has imposed on them. He tells them he means to push them, till they can travel almost as fast as Aiel.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

Below, there are three wading pools, around which many beautiful people are performing.\nGraendal appears and they begin to talk; she comments on her pets, and Sammael thinks to himself how Graendal always wastes time on useless things. His mind wanders, and he remembers how it was Graendal that took him to make his pledges to the Dark One. Graendal continues to speak of her pets, mentioning that Ramsid is the Domani King's brother; Ramsid's wife is also there, along with the King's youngest sister and eldest daughter. She moves on to Chiape and Shaofan, the rulers of Shara. As Graendal begins to speak of Shara, Sammael wonders if she is trying to make him think that she is interested in Shara, in an attempt to divert his attentions.\nAfter a bit of small talk and much thinking on Sammael's part, he approaches the subject of what Graendal wanted to talk to him about. They speak shortly of Rand, and also of the whereabouts of Asmodean, Lanfear and Moghedien. Graendal mentions that \"Lews Therin seems to be removing us from the game one by one.\" She also tells Sammael that she is certain that Rand will be going after him next. They speak of Rand's power, Sammael insisting that he is ignorant and hanging by a thread, Graendal insisting that he is getting stronger and stronger. \"How many of us will die before it is done? We must stand together as we never have before.\"\nFinally, Graendal tells Sammael what she had meant to tell him. She says that Semirhage missed their last gathering, and that neither she, Demandred or Mesaana know why. Mesaana thinks that Rand will soon be in their hands, and Demandred warns him to be careful. Sammael becomes angry thinking about Demandred, and Graendal tells him to relax and listen to the music that Chiape and Shaofan are making, before starting to talk about Shara again. Sammael is now almost certain that Graendal wants to make him think that she has an interest in Shara. He prepares to leave, with a bit more talk about Rand. He opens a gateway back to Illian, slicing a serving man in two as he does so, and leaves."

Her intent had actually been to aim him at Rand. Her thoughts turn to Demandred, Mesaana and Semirhage.

When Cabriana will not answer any more questions, Semirhage sets a web of pain over Cabriana's mind and leaves the room, where she is confronted by Shaidar Haran, who asks what she has learned. Semirhage says that she has only learned her name, but that she has not had enough time yet.\nShe makes her way into another room, where Cabriana's Warder is. Instead of using pain on him, she stimulates his mind with pleasure. Her thoughts wander to Shaidar Haran, Rand, Graendal, Sammael, Demandred, Mesaana, Lanfear, Moghedien and Asmodean. When she finally comes back to the present, she realizes that the stimulation had grown too fast, and that Cabriana's Warder is dead.\nAlarmed that his death might have some unknown affect on the Aes Sedai, whom she still needs to question, she hurries back to Cabriana, who is now screaming from the pain. \"Pleeeeaaaase! Oh, Light, PLEEEEAAAASE!\" Semirhage smiles.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

Elayne is telling Nynaeve that they must get there before the Aes Sedai leaders, whom they are teaching about the World of Dreams. They each take one of the ter'angreal rings that Elayne has made. Elayne is studying her ring, trying to figure out why the ones that she has made do not work as well as the original, when Nynaeve asks if she is going to sit there all night. They each take a drink of the herbal drink that Nynaeve had prepared to help them sleep, and then lie down. They speak shortly of Egwene, who they know was harmed in Cairhien on the day that Moiraine and Lanfear died, before Nynaeve falls asleep. As Elayne drifts off, she thinks about the Hall of the Tower in Salidar, and of how they have been so slow to make decisions.\nWhen Elayne arrives in Tel'aran'rhiod, Nynaeve, Siuan and Leane are waiting for her. Finally, Sheriam, Carlinya, Morvrin, Myrelle, Anaiya and Beonin appear. Much thinking occurs on Elayne's part, mostly about Tel'aran'rhiod, the Aes Sedai, the Wise Ones and Egwene.\nThe first place they go in Tel'aran'rhiod is to Elaida's study in the White Tower. When Leane disappears to go check if her eyes-and-ears have received her messages, Myrelle tells Nynaeve to go with her.\nOnce Nynaeve has left, Elaida appears, dreaming. \"As I have Foretold, the White Tower will be reunited under me. Under me!\" She leaves, and Anaiya points out that the blue stripe has been removed from Elaida's stole.\nMorvrin, Carlinya and Anaiya make their way to the Keeper's worktable, and Sheriam, Beonin and Myrelle go to search Elaida's desk. They read many reports, among them reports on the arrest warrant for Moiraine, the fighting in Arafel and Shienar, and of the Blight still being quiet. There are strange occurrences in Cairhien and Illian, Elayne is to be returned to the White Tower as soon as possible, and Elaida has sent emissaries to Rand. Beonin tells them that it seems that Elaida means to support Rand, and that she is offering him an escort to the Tower. Their conversation is cut short when they hear a scream, and shouts from the anteroom. They all rush to find out what has happened, and step into a nightmare.\nThey find themselves in a stone cavern that is filled with Trollocs. Carlinya is bound and hanging by her ankles from a chain, and is being lowered headfirst into a bubbling kettle of boiling oil. Anaiya and Morvrin are standing at the border of the nightmare, and are then transported into it. Morvrin finds herself being stretched tightly on great iron wheels, and Anaiya is being dangled by her wrists while Trollocs flog her with metal tipped whips. Sheriam announces to the other two Aes Sedai with her that they must link, but Elayne tells them that they must not accept this nightmare as being real. However, the Aes Sedai do not listen, link, and try to attack with fire. The weave vanishes at the edge of the nightmare, and then the three Aes Sedai are drawn in. Sheriam's head is sticking up from a dark metal bell shape, and Trollocs are jerking levers on the outside.\nElayne asks Siuan if she remembers what she and Nynaeve had told them about dispelling nightmares, and Siuan nods, replying that they must deny that they are reality. Elayne and Siuan try to picture the hallway as it had been, but nothing changes, and they realize that they need help. They don't know where Leane and Nynaeve are, so their only hope is the Aes Sedai. They both step into the nightmare.\nElayne finds herself lying on her belly on rough gray stone, with her wrists and ankles tied in the small of her back. Siuan starts screaming to Sheriam, telling her to believe that it is a dream, and Elayne takes up the refrain.\nFinally, suddenly, they are back in the hallway. Siuan is a mass of bruises, Carlinya's hair has been burned down to a hand from her scalp, Sheriam and Anaiya seem to be \"weeping heaps of bloody rags,\" Myrelle is naked and covered in welts, Morvrin is moving unnaturally, and Beonin's dress has been clawed to shreds. All of the Aes Sedai want to go back to Salidar, but Siuan says that she will stay. Elayne wishes to stay with Siuan, but the Aes Sedai tell her not to be foolish and to return with them.\nWhen the Aes Sedai disappear, Elayne knows that she has a few moments before anyone will check in on her, so she transports herself to the Grand Hall in the Caemlyn Palace. What she finds dismays her terribly. The Lion Throne is sitting on some kind of pedestal, while a throne made of golden Dragons sits on the dais. She wonders what Rand thinks he is doing. She finally steps out of Tel'aran'rhiod."

As she and Elayne ready themselves for the day, Elayne tells her about what had happened in Tel'aran'rhiod after Nynaeve and Leane had left. Nynaeve begins to grumble about how the Aes Sedai think they know everything, and then mentions to Elayne that she thinks she saw Rand in Tel'aran'rhiod, and Elayne bemoans the fact that she isn't with him.\nAfter they finish dressing and Elayne leaves, Nynaeve wanders off to find Moghedien. She finds the Forsaken washing clothes with some other women. The woman in charge tells Nynaeve that Myrelle had told her that \"Marigan\" could help with the washing, so Nynaeve takes off. As she walks, she sees Myrelle, but luckily for Nynaeve, the Aes Sedai does not notice her.\nEventually, she finds Logain, who is surrounded by people. He is telling them his story of how the Red Ajah set him up as a false Dragon. Lelaine and her Warder, Burin Shaeren, are keeping watch over him. When he finishes his tale, Lelaine assures them that Logain no longer wants glory, and that their lands are in no danger from him. When Lelaine notices Nynaeve, Nynaeve hastily curtsies and then hurries off.\nNext, Nynaeve comes upon Siuan, who is facing off Gareth Bryne. They are fighting over the fact that he tried to pay her a compliment, and how she had nearly snapped his head off for it. After Gareth leaves, Nynaeve informs Siuan that she means to study her stilling, since Nynaeve has only had two chances so far to study her.\nLeane shows up. \"I tried to talk them out of it. Only they had not listened to you enough to even consider it. You won't be meeting the Wise Ones tonight.\" When Leane and Siuan stalk off, Lelaine, who was standing behind them, remarks that Siuan and Leane should be sent off to Tiana, the Mistress of Novices, for always seeming to fight with each other. Lelaine then asks Nynaeve what she thinks Rand will do. Nynaeve tells Lelaine that she has not seen Rand in half a year, and that she knows nothing of what he is doing. Lelaine goes on to mention Egwene, Mat and Perrin. Lelaine then tries to talk Nynaeve out of trying to Heal Siuan and Leane, but she refuses.\nWhen Nynaeve leaves, she passes by Uno, who is training heavy cavalry for the Salidar army. He smiles at her, and she moves on. She eventually runs into Elayne's novice class. As she watches, Theodrin approaches her. They speak of Nynaeve's block, and Theodrin informs Nynaeve that they will work on breaking Nynaeve's block the next day.\nNynaeve goes back to her room to lie down, when Moghedien bursts into the room, angry that her hands are wrinkly from doing laundry. Nynaeve tells Moghedien that she wants to go over the lesson of learning to detect a man channeling saidin again.\nAfter quite a while of practicing, Elayne enters the room, with the news that an emissary from the White Tower has arrived.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

They speak of, among other things, the people that are arriving in Caemlyn, the way that Rand twists chance, and Morgase. Bael also mentions that two Aes Sedai are staying in the New City. Rand decides that this may be something important, and says that he will go visit them.\nWhen Rand arrives at the inn, he finds a huge surprise awaiting him: there is a group of girls, perhaps a dozen, from the Two Rivers in the common room. Among them are Bodewhin Cauthon, Hilde Barran, Jerilin al'Caar, Marisa Ahan, Emry Lewin, Elise Marwin, Darea Candwin, Larine Ayellin, Jancy Torfinn, Susa al'Seen, and Marce Eldin. Bodewhin asks about Mat, and mentions that they have come with Verin and Alanna because all of them can learn to channel. All of the girls from the Emond's Field area crowd around him and begin talking, telling him of all that has happened since he left.\nEventually, Verin and Alanna appear. The two Aes Sedai and Rand leave to speak alone in the innkeeper, Master Dilham's, private dining room. The first thing that Rand asks is if they will be taking the Two Rivers girls to the rebels, or to Elaida. Rand wants to know more about the rebels, but Alanna and Verin will not tell him.\nAfter a little more talking, Alanna steps towards Rand. He steps back from her, but she tells him not to worry. \"Like you, Rand, I mean no harm. Nothing I do here will cause you any injury.\" He decides to trust her, since she had said it straight out. Verin and Alanna link, and Alanna bonds him as her Warder without asking. He demands to know what they did, and seizes saidin. Verin and Alanna try to shield him, but he ends up shielding them instead. They tell him what Alanna did, and he tells him that they are to stay away from him, and that the Inner City of Caemlyn is barred to them. He then storms out of the room.\nOut in the common room, Bodewhin and Larine confront him, saying that Bashere has been telling them crazy things, such as that Rand is the Dragon Reborn. Rand informs him that it is the truth, and when they don't believe him, he lifts the two girls into the air using the One Power. \"I am the Dragon Reborn. Denying won't change it. I'm not the man you knew back in Emond's Field. Do you understand now? Do you?\" All of the girls are terrified, and he sets them back down, trying to apologize.\nHe leaves, thinking to himself that it is best that they are afraid of them, that it was best that he forgot about the Two Rivers.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

However, it is revealed that Faile had threatened Alanna against bonding Perrin. So, Perrin is not bonded and now Alanna has bonded Rand against his will.\nWhile Verin has Alanna off guard speaking about Rand, she brings up the amnesty that Rand has issued in regards to men who can channel. Verin and Alanna put their heads together to try and figure out where Rand is keeping the men who have answered his amnesty. As much as they don't want to believe it, they can't take any chances.

Moghedien says that they \"should\" get through but it could take days to spin through the ward. Nynaeve bites her tongue because they have been trying for days. This is the third day since Tarna had arrived and there was still no word on what message she had brought.\nElayne tries to hand the a'dam bracelet to Nynaeve so she can go teach her novice classes and try to show Aes Sedai how to make ter'angreal again. Nynaeve refuses and tells Elayne to wear it instead of leaving it behind. She still doesn't trust Moghedien but hates wearing the thing herself. Besides, she has work to do for some Sitters and another lesson with Theodrin.\nNynaeve feels that everyone is just wasting time around Salidar and not really doing anything. Moghedien picks up on Nynaeve's thoughts and starts suggesting that her and Elayne run off to Caemlyn to be with Rand. Nynaeve wonders why Moghedien looks so calm. She realizes that the bracelet isn't in the room. She has never been alone with Moghedien without the bracelet. She gets nervous and reminds Moghedien that she would suffer death if they left and anyone found out who she was. Moghedien says that the a'dam will hold her just as well in Caemlyn and that they better hurry up before Salidar decided to reunite the Tower and turn them over to Elaida. Nynaeve tells her to clean up and leaves before she loses her stomach.\nUpon leaving, she searches out Birgitte. She asks her to get horses so they can leave, but not to tell anyone like Thom or Uno. Birgitte thinks that is a bad idea and says that if Elayne agrees and gives the order, she will get the horses. Nynaeve then tries to get Birgitte to listen at the door to find out what is happening. Birgitte soundly refuses and Nynaeve fights not to lose her temper.\nNicola shows up and reminds Nynaeve that she is due at the Sitters' house to do her copy work for them.

They finally let her go and she hurries to her lesson with Theodrin.\nOn her way there she passes the Hall and decides to try to eavesdrop at the window since Birgitte wouldn't do it. She over hears the Hall saying that they need more time to consider. That is the answer to the Tower envoy. Tarna leaves and everyone keeps talking. Nynaeve hears them mention something about waiting on \"the biddable child\" and that they had to be careful. There is conjecture as to what will happen and if everyone's heads will end up on spikes and who will put them there. The ward disappears and Nynaeve stumbles to get away as quickly as possible.\nShe is brushing off her dress and looks up to find Theodrin standing over her. Theodrin says nothing and they proceed to walk away. She asks Nynaeve if she has managed to keep calm, another part of her instructions from a previous lesson. Nynaeve says yes and Theodrin replies that she intends to try something a little more direct today to break her block. Neither of them notice that a woman was watching them from the second story window."

Finally she tells Nynaeve not to sleep tonight to see if exhaustion will help and sends her on her way. Nynaeve heads straight to her and Elayne's room. Elayne is there and complaining about her day. Nynaeve gives up trying to break the litany and just shouts that she thinks Moghedien is right and they should go to Caemlyn. Nynaeve tells Elayne about eavesdropping and what she overheard. Elayne still thinks they should stay in Salidar. Nynaeve feels saidar being drawn and the door comes open, Tarna Feir walking in.\nTarna says that it would be a good idea if Elayne returns with her. Elayne says she will return when everyone does. At this point, Tarna dismisses Elayne and wants to talk to Nynaeve alone. Once alone, she goes about trying to convince Nynaeve to return with her as well, saying that she is highly valuable because of her knowledge of Rand. She also asks if Nynaeve knows where Egwene is. Tarna continues to try to bribe and subtly threaten Nynaeve into going. Nynaeve stands firm and refuses the same as Elayne. After she leaves, Nynaeve goes looking for Elayne. Elayne has two of the rings to go into Tel'aran'rhiod. Nynaeve tries again to get her to go to Caemlyn, especially after Tarna's visit. Tarna's visit has just set Elayne's mind even more about staying in Salidar. She suggests they use the rings to go into Tel'aran'rhiod and use need to try and find something that will convince the Hall not to go back to Elaida.\nDespite Theodrin's orders, Nynaeve goes to sleep and both of them go into Tel'aran'rhiod. The first time they try to search, after briefly thinking they saw Egwene, they end up in the unused storerooms in Tar Valon. This leads both of them to think that they might be looking for an angreal of some sort. They focus on the need of an angreal not in Tar Valon. After many tries they end up in a room facing a chest. Upon looking in the chest they find a crystal bowl. When Elayne channels into it, she thinks she feels other angreal in the room. They both leave the room and try to figure out where they are. Eventually Elayne figures out that it is Ebou Dar. Elayne says they should go to Ebou Dar and look for this cache of angreal. Nynaeve is relieved. As long as it is getting out of Salidar, she is happy. They return to their bodies. Elayne drifts off to sleep. Nynaeve thinks about it and decides to stay up as instructed. She desperately wants to break her block and be able to channel whenever. She doesn't realize she starts to cry."

She wonders if any of the Aes Sedai in Salidar know about them, but she has no way of letting them know.\nShe continues to wander around and think of the two women she keeps seeing in Tel'aran'rhiod. One of them is a young beautiful Domani woman that looks rather misty. The other is a sturdy yet pretty woman with blue eyes and a very determined face. She seemed very solid and was popping up in many places that Egwene had tried to go. She had even been in Tear. Egwene was simply trying to learn hints and pieces of what was going on in the world, trying to learn something of Elaida's plans, anything that might prove useful.\nAfter deciding against trying to break the ward on Rand's dreams again, she thinks about trying to locate Salidar again through Nynaeve and Elayne. She knows their dreams right away. While she is looking around, she keeps seeing one particular pinprick. It seems to be moving toward her and eventually does envelop her. She finds herself in a room with both Rand and Gawyn. They both pull swords and start fighting over her. Gawyn is dreaming of rescuing her from Rand. After killing Rand, Gawyn embraces Egwene and confesses his love for her. After many tries to break out of the dream, Egwene finally gives in to his kisses."

Then she dreams of Mat and speaking the Old Tongue. She sees two ravens on his shoulders, talons digging into his flesh. She also sees a shrouded woman beckoning him into danger. Then her dreams shift to Rand. She sees Elayne forcing him to his knees, or Elayne, Min and Aviendha in a circle around him, all reaching out to touch him. Then she sees him walking toward a burning mountain, his boots crunching the seals on the Dark One prison as he walks.\nShe wakes with Cowinde trying to wake her for breakfast. After snapping at Cowinde, she feels bad, but as she politely says she doesn't feel like eating, Amys, Melaine and Bair come into her tent. They were thinking of letting her go back to the meetings with the Aes Sedai in Tel'aran'rhiod. However, upon hearing she doesn't want breakfast they are rethinking that.\nAmys admits that she tried to look into her dreams several times and couldn't find them. One cannot heal if one doesn't dream. This makes her fear that they might have caught her on her excursion. Melaine frowns at Cowinde and orders her to dig through a pile of sand and find one red grain. If it isn't the one red grain she is looking for, Cowinde will do it again. She is trying to convince the woman to stop being gai'shain.\nMany more are refusing to put off the robes now after everything Rand has revealed about the origins of the Aiel. Egwene thinks she would gladly dig through the sand just to keep the Wise Ones from finding out she had been in Tel'aran'rhiod without permission. Thinking they have offended Egwene when talking about the \"wetlanders\" and the effects they have had on people, they tell Egwene not to worry, they are not upset with her. They then tell her that one of the Aes Sedai has \"suggested\" that they are holding Egwene against her will.\nAfter giggling with the Wise Ones over their description of \"teaching\" Carlinya Sedai that she didn't know anything, Egwene begins asking questions. She asks if you can be pulled into someone's dream unwillingly. Bair says not unless the emotion is very strong. Continuing to ask questions, Egwene has steered them clear of dangerous questions."

Rand dismisses Norry and Bashere presents four of the most powerful nobles in Andor. Lady Dyelin, Lord Abelle, Lady Ellorien and Lord Luan. Rand is following Moiraine's advice and behaves like a king. The four are obviously not at ease and they are trying to find out how much of what they heard about Rand is true. They are visibly relieved to see Bashere leave. He is a foreign Lord with an army in Andor. Maybe his influence isn't quite as big as they feared.\nAndorans are more straightforward then Cairhienin or Tairens so Rand keeps it simple. He won't tell them what to believe of the countless rumours about him that they must have heard. What he wants is to make sure Elayne gets the Lion Throne and then leave governing to her. Luan, Ellorien and Abelle seem to think Rand has a hidden agenda. They speak for Dyelin who after Elayne is next in line for the throne. Dyelin, however, speaks for Elayne. She says she will see what the Dragon Reborn does and will, if he does what he promises, support him in the Last Battle. If he doesn't, however, she will come against him and the other three declare they would support her. That is enough for Rand at the moment so he breaks up the meeting.\nBefore the nobles leave he takes Dyelin aside for a moment and asks why many of the Andoran nobles look at him strangely. Dyelin tells him he looks like Tigraine, the Daughter-Heir who disappeared some twenty-five years ago. Some blame Gitara Moroso for that disappearance and that of her brother Luc. Her story fits with what Rand knows about his mother from the Wise Ones.\nWhen the four nobles leave Bashere announces the next visitor - a messenger from Sammael. The man has a grin plastered to his face but looks disturbing nonetheless. Sammael proposes a truce. He is happy to stay in Illian for now and not face Rand before he has to at Tarmon Gai'don. Rand tells the messenger that there will be no truce with the Shadow. Sammael will be brought to justice for his crimes. Upon hearing Rand's reply the messenger collapses in a puddle of blood and flesh. Rand assumes Sammael got the message.\nSickened with Andor for the moment, Rand wants to leave for Cairhien. To get away from Alanna as much as anything. Aviendha who just appeared at the scene requests to accompany him. She wants to speak to the Wise Ones. Bashere reminds him he was supposed to inspect the Saldaean troops that afternoon. Rand promises to do that tomorrow or the day after and opens a gateway.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

He asks to be taken to Berelain or Rhuarc, whoever is closer. The pair finds him before he can find them however. In his head Lews Therin hums appreciative of Berelain's gown.\nOn the way to the office Rhuarc and Berelain share they walk past a group of women practising the sword, inspired by the Maidens of the Spear. The Aiel are upset over this because these women claim to follow ji'e'toh. According to the Aiel they get it all wrong. Berelain promised not to send the women back to their families though. Rand thinks that this may be a way to heal the wounded pride of the Cairhienin and will allow it as long as they stop pretending to follow ji'e'toh.\nWhen they arrive at the office Rand asks how things are in Cairhien. Both answer things are as well as can be expected. Caraline Damodred and Toram Riatin are still gathering people for their rebellion but most Cairhienin seem tired of war. Rumour has it that some Andorans joined them though. The Shaido are still in the Kinslayer's Dagger, showing signs of settling on this side of the Dragonwall. There is also word of fighting in Shara, highly unusual for that part of the world. Sammael is highest on the list of priorities though, the rest can wait.\nTrade is slowly resuming with peddlers coming from Tear, Andor and Murandy. Some of the lands closer to the Dragonwall are being resettled so that next year the grain shortage may be over. If the drought ever lets up of course. There is also a Sea Folk ship docked in Cairhien. A rare occurrence to see one so far from the Ocean.\nMangin, one of the Aiel who helped take the Stone of Tear walks in. He wants to speak with the Dragon Reborn. Both Rhuarc and Berelain say he should talk to the man. It turns out Mangin has killed a Cairhienin for showing off his tattoos of dragons. It was a fake of course but the Aiel thought him so honorless he deserved death. This is against the new law Rand declared so he has no choice but to hang the man. Mangin says he will report for his hanging at the time Rand decides on.

He's been gone for five years now and being away from the stedding for too long is dangerous for Ogier.\nRand tells them Loial went to the Two Rivers last time Rand saw him, in the company of good friends who will look after him. Loial's fianc\u00e9e Erith, insists they go on right away. Rand realizes that the Ogier can help him close the Waygates the Shadow has been using to move groups of Shadowspawn and offers the Ogier hospitality for a few days. After he explains the Shadow is using the Ways Haman agrees to help.\nRand turns to the nearest Maiden, Sulin as it turns out, and yells for maps. He tells her to run. A visibly offended Sulin goes to relay the order and soon servants start to arrive. Rand and the Ogier set to work locating all the stedding. The Ogier are amazed at how much knowledge is lost to the humans. When Haman is done with the list of existing and lost stedding, groves and other places a Waygate was located, Rand notices one in particular. The one at Shadar Logoth. He asks if Haman can show them if Rand takes them there.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

Although he believes it too dangerous, the two Ogier women (Covril and Erith) insist because Traveling there will take them most of the way to the Two Rivers, and Loial, instantly. Once the decision is made, they are ready to depart instantly. Sulin, however, insists on having a slow count of fifty to gather Aiel to guard Rand. In her hurry, she spoke to gai'shain as Far Dareis Mai. She says she will \"deal with it when Rand al'Thor is safe today.\" When the Aiel are assembled, Rand warns them not to touch anything or go in the buildings, and they go through a gateway into Shadar Logoth. Rand lets the gateway go, but holds onto the Source.\nIn Shadar Logoth, Rand feels the unseen watchers, although it is only mid-morning. \"When he had been here before, that feeling had not come this strongly until the sun began to go down.\" Lews Therin seems to address Rand, but he decides it was merely happenstance brought on by the location. Rand thinks back on the results of his previous visit as Haman leads them to the Waygate. Rand does not want to remove the keys, as the gate may one day be needed, so he puts a very nasty weave around it to kill Shadowspawn. It would kill them slowly, so the next Fade to come through would not be warned. As he channels, he feels the taint so strongly it pulsed, even releasing saidin afterwards doesn't help completely. He decides that it was the evil in Shadar Logoth resonating with the evil of the taint. As he prepares to Travel again, he realizes someone was missing. The Aiel discover it was Liah. Rand becomes very angry and orders a careful search in pairs. He reiterates that they shouldn't go into the buildings or shadows.\nThe sense of the unseen watchers fades at midday, but grows strong again soon after. Rand makes them search until the sun begins to set, and then reluctantly gives up. He takes everyone to a field in the Two Rivers that he thought was abandoned. He found instead a boy watching a flock of sheep and a tile roofed farmhouse nearby. He points the Ogier in the direction of Emond's Field. Haman tells Rand that he mustn't kill himself. Rand replies that he won't, and returns to Caemlyn."

The rumor of Dragonsworn is then brought up, which Mat declares is Rand's problem.\nMat's best scout, Chel Vanin, rides up and says that he has found something that Mat has to see. They ride a short ways off and come to what had been a Tinker caravan. There are dead everywhere. \"Whoever did this had not wanted any survivors.\" On the bottom of an overturned wagon, one man had written in his own blood, \"TELL THE DRAGON REBORN\" before he died. Mat tells Vanin to burn the wagon and tell no one about the message. Mat returns to the army and tells them to make camp, even though there are a few hours of daylight left.\nDisturbed by what he had seen, Mat is unable to sleep, and so takes his spear and blankets outside so he can count constellations. While doing this, he hears a soft noise and, looking around, sees several Aiel surround his tent, enter, then come out again. As he wondered if he could slip away, Talmanes approaches his tent, offering brandy. Seeing that he wasn't going to leave, Mat leaps up and shouts that there are Aiel in the camp. The Aiel attack him, but he manages to keep them off until his men start arriving, at which point he gets out of the way.\nAfter it is over, Mat investigates the sound he had heard and finds some ropes and a nearby bush that had been cut by a gateway. He realizes that the Aiel were sent by one of the Forsaken. He hears a sound behind him, and just barely manages to avoid killing Olver with his spear. He is surprised to find Olver there, as he believed that they had left him in Maerone. Nerim then arrives, sent by Talmanes, to sew up the wounds Mat had received from the Aiel. To distract himself from the needle, he has Olver show him what is in his cloth scrip. As an excuse for giving Olver two gold crowns, Mat makes him a messenger and hopes that he isn't putting the boy in the line of fire by keeping him near."

As she wanders, she listens to rumors. One claims the Aes Sedai are at war with each other. As Egwene thinks about Aes Sedai, she starts looking around differently, wondering who might be an Aes Sedai spy. She worries that someone might report her as an Aes Sedai, until she realizes that everyone sees her as an Aiel.\nShe goes on listening to rumors, though she has become accustomed to knowing things shortly after they occur, thanks to Elaida's desk. When one man is set on by four others for claiming that Rand was one of the Forsaken, Egwene steps in and starts lecturing them as if they followed ji'e'toh. Until she realized what she was doing.

The Wise Ones hope she will be able to remember more, as Aes Sedai shield their dreams. Egwene asks where they are staying, and learns they went to the house of a noble named Lady Arilyn. Egwene concludes that she is a spy for the Gray Ajah. Egwene also learns that they brought over five hundred guards, one hundred of which they brought into the city. They make plans to keep watch.\nAfter breakfast, Egwene goes into town and, after asking for directions a few times, finds Lady Arilyn's palace.

She makes a couple of changes to make the speech stronger, and cuts out a lot of stuff, before naming Sheriam as her Keeper of the Chronicles.

Sheriam informs her that all of the Sitters had had a hand in writing the speech, and that they will not be pleased that Egwene cut out a lot of it. She then questions the wisdom of raising the four Accepted to Aes Sedai. Romanda and Lelaine enter at that moment and agree. \"It seemed necessary,\" Egwene says. \"I thought of it last night. I've been raised Aes Sedai without being tested or taking the Three Oaths, and if I was the only one, it would just point me out.

They speak of Rand, the Lion Throne of Andor, and the ter'angreal that Elayne and Nynaeve believe can change the weather.

After thinking of Alanna and the rest of the Aes Sedai in the city - eleven, including Alanna and Verin - he weaves a gateway to the farm, letting go of saidin as soon as he steps through. Lews Therin may try and seize the Power from him again when they see Taim.\nAs Rand steps into the clearing of the farm from the woods he had Traveled to, he notes it has changed until it is almost unrecognisable. The place itself is well repaired, and there are many students of all ages, training and doing chores; women and children also sit, work, and play off to the side. Most of those training and doing chores wear long black coats with high collars.\nOne of these men approaches Rand and arrogantly asks who he is; when he receives an answer, he begins to say something even more arrogant - a flow of Air knocks him out. Taim appears, and tells two nearby students to drag the unconscious one away and wake him, without Healing. As they do so, Taim turns back to Rand, and they begin to speak. Taim informs Rand that Healing is the first thing the students are taught. Rand also learns that three students have been burned out, and one has died so far.\nThe farm had been given the name the Black Tower by the students and, though hesitant at first, Rand decides to let the name stand. On that note, he tells Taim to gather the students, so he can address them.\nRand's announcement has to do with rank; he establishes that the first rank, upon entering the Black Tower, will be soldier; then Dedicated - who will wear a silver sword pin on their collar to show rank - and finally, Asha'man (meaning 'Guardian'), whose rank will be shown by a gold dragon pin, worn on the other side of the collar. Rand gives Taim - who looks incredibly expressionless - the two pins; then, when the students are dismissed, begins to speak with Taim in the farmhouse. Taim believes that their numbers will be equal with that of the White Tower within a year. After this, Lews Therin tries to reach for the Source again to kill Taim, but Rand stops him, muttering that he is dead. Taim says, in turn, that Rand must hold on to sanity a while longer.

He first dances with Halima, but quickly leaves. When he has gone just a few steps, his medallion goes cold - he turns and sees Halima staring at him. When he asks someone if she is Aes Sedai, though, they tell him she is but a secretary; he decides it must have been another Aes Sedai, and moves away from the area.\nMyrelle begins speaking to him; he realises what she is getting at, though, and declines bonding her. After, he asks Siuan Sanche to dance without realising who she really is, and is beyond shocked when he learns the truth. He is, however, soon swept away to dance by a beautiful Domani - Leane. He nearly stumbles, and after Leane kisses him at the end of the piece, the man leaves to go to sleep.\nIn the morning, Mat realises Olver had come to Salidar. That evening, Myrelle asks about bonding again, but he turns her down again - and it had not been the first offer that day; one of those requesting had been Halima's 'mistress.'\nThe second day there, he is called by a novice to see Egwene. He is given the choice of either leaving Salidar completely, or leaving Salidar with Elayne and Nynaeve for Ebou Dar. The next day, Mat prepares to leave for Ebou Dar; he tells Talmanes that, if Salidar packs up, to follow, but not close enough to alarm.\nElayne, Nynaeve, Thom, Juilin, Birgitte, Aviendha, and two other Aes Sedai - Vandene and Adeleas - finally arrive. Mat is astounded to hear that it will take at least five days to reach Ebou Dar; he confronts Elayne, and hates how her reasoning that it is too dangerous to create a gateway close to the city is right. Egwene arrives at that moment with a bunch of Aes Sedai behind her; she seemingly walks alone.

Demira tells of the words the Aiel had growled before she blacked out: \"Tell the other witches to stay away from al'Thor.\" They decide she was speared to hurt severely, but not kill.\nSimilarly, they draw to a conclusion that it was Rand who sent the Aiel; Demira suggests that they mention nothing, to make Rand sweat it out. Just then, Verin appears, motioning for Stevan to leave, and says she agrees with Demira; she also believes that the injured Aes Sedai can choose how al'Thor should be taught his lesson.\nAnd so, Demira suggests that the embassy send nobody for a few days, to let him stew; watching Min will tell them how he is reacting."

As the two Aes Sedai are led to the Queen, Nynaeve sees Jaichim Carridin; it turns out that the Whitecloaks had sent an embassy, too; months ago.\nWhen they arrive to meet the Queen - who is sceptical that they are Aes Sedai - she tells them to 'lean back on their knives and let their tongues go free.' They speak first of the Whitecloaks - Tylin needs much aid because she wants her son to have the throne after her - then Elayne speaks of their search for the ter'angreal. The Queen says that she hopes they will not change; her previous advisor, Cavandra, who had returned to the Tower, had been as good to speak with. They then speak of the best way to search the Rahad - where, from Elayne's description, the Queen says the ter'angreal is - and stay safe. As Elayne and Nynaeve leave, on their way back to their apartments, Elayne makes a wager with Nynaeve that it will take ten days to find the ter'angreal."

Egwene is asking Logain what he thinks about the amnesty that Rand is offering; is it possible for men to hold off the madness like Logain has done? She reminds him that he would probably be given a place of honor in the Black Tower while here there is still a good chance he could be gentled.\nLogain is shocked that the Aes Sedai could still think of gentling him after all he has done for them. Egwene tells him the Hall will decide in a few days what to do with him. This makes Logain angry and he lunges at Egwene, but she wraps him up in flows of Air. Logain is angry and yells that he wishes he were with Rand instead of the Aes Sedai; she promises him that neither she nor any of her followers will harm him if she can help it. Egwene promises to speak with him again when he is calm. She leaves.\nEgwene walks back through the camp; Gareth Bryne's forces have grown and the Band is no more than ten miles behind them. The march has brought many nobles to Egwene who have sworn fealty to her. She is still uncomfortable, though, with the idea of Aes Sedai blood being spilled. Egwene eats dinner and retires to her tent. Chesa helps her undress while giving her the latest gossip. Egwene puts herself to sleep and steps into Tel'aran'rhiod.\nElayne and Nynaeve soon join her. The two report that they haven't found the Bowl of the Winds yet but that they do not think it will be much longer. Egwene asks if they ought to come back with the rest of the rebel Aes Sedai; she doesn't want them hurt. Nynaeve and Elayne protest and Egwene drops the idea. Egwene asks if they are making use of Mat. Elayne says that they are. Egwene tells Nynaeve not to be too hard on Mat. Elayne asks if Egwene has been able to talk to the Aiel dreamwalkers and find out whether something can be found with need twice. Egwene reports that it cannot be done so there is no use trying to find the storeroom with the Bowl of the Winds through need again.\nElayne asks about Rand. Egwene tells her he is in Cairhien, as far as she knows, and she reports that Perrin and Faile got married. Elayne asks her to pass a message along to Min: that Elayne hopes Min will like Aviendha as much as she does. Elayne says her goodbyes and leaves. Nynaeve stays a minute longer and asks Egwene if there is news of Lan. Egwene tells her that there is not.\nEgwene wakes herself to find Siuan sitting in her tent. Siuan has come to report that their plan to free Logain has been set into motion. The Gaidin guarding him have been drugged. Egwene asks if she is doing the right thing; she practically answers herself, saying that the Hall will gentle him otherwise. Egwene tells Siuan to make sure that Logain doesn't hurt anyone when he leaves."

Perrin is shocked by what he sees people doing - randomly kissing each others, women without shirts on and general drunkenness. He thinks that the Women's Circle back home would have a fit if they saw this. Perrin is worried because Rand and Min have been gone for six days without any word. Perrin thinks to himself that even Elaida's emissaries are disgusted, as they left the city three days ago.\nPerrin arrives at the Sun Palace and goes to his rooms, finding Faile there playing stones with Loial. She ignores Perrin. Sulin comes in, bringing a pillow for the room; she answers a knock at the door. Dobraine comes in. Perrin notices that he is sombre and completely sober. Dobraine asks to speak to Perrin alone; Perrin says that he can say anything in front of his wife and Loial - he has no secrets from them. Dobraine informs Perrin that there have been two murders that day, most unusual for the Feast of Lights. He also reports that Colavaere has begun seeking support for her claim to the Sun Throne. Perrin tells Dobraine that if Colavaere has committed a crime he should speak to Rhuarc.\nDobraine doesn't like that idea, and he would rather go to Berelain. Berelain enters the room just then. Perrin is infuriated that she has come to flirt with him in front of his wife and he yells at her to get out of the room. A startled Berelain drops the bundle she had been carrying; Perrin recognizes the items as Rand's sword and Dragon buckle, which she has found left behind. Sulin immediately figures out that Rand has been kidnapped and starts wailing. Berelain tells Sulin to be quiet, not recognizing her as Aiel. This makes Sulin mad, so she storms into the hallway and orders a Maiden to run and get Rhuarc, Nandera and cadin'sor for her.\nPerrin is not convinced that Rand has been kidnapped. There were only three Aes Sedai in the Grand Hall the day he was kidnapped as far as he knows. Berelain moves closer to him but Perrin orders her to stay put. Berelain complies and tells him that she herself has been \"strongly advised\" by Aes Sedai to return to Mayene with the impression that if she didn't leave willingly she'd be forced. That is why she searched Rand's apartment. Dobraine has also been urged to leave. He believes it is Colavaere's doing as she wants the Sun Throne for herself and not Elayne.\nPerrin is convinced and announces that he will get Rand back. Loial is determined to accompany him. Dobraine says he can have five hundred men by the next day. Sorilea, Rhuarc and Nandera enter around this time, bringing Sulin cadin'sor and scissors to cut her hair. Rhuarc says that he can bring Maidens of the Spear and siswai'aman, but no other Aiel will fight Aes Sedai. Perrin asks how so few can stand up to so many Aes Sedai who can channel. Sorilea tells him not to worry, as Aes Sedai aren't the only women who can channel!"

Rand spotted her and went into a fury that she had been captured as well. He had tried to break through his shield and in the process killed a Warder with his bare hands and severely wounded another (the second ended up dying from the shock of attempted Healing).\nShe sets off looking for Gawyn, who has been withdrawn ever since Rand's capture.

Erian hasn't been far from the box since Rand was put back in to it the previous night. Erian furiously informs Galina that Rand has tried to break through the shield again and that she wants to be the one who punishes him. Galina hesitates.

This infuriates her and she lashes him harder. Rand is in so much pain that he temporarily loses his vision. When the beating finally stops and his vision returns, he thinks he is hallucinating, as he sees Aiel Wise Ones.\nIt takes him a minute but he finally recognizes Sevanna and figures out that the Aes Sedai must be allied with the Shaido. Sevanna strolls up to him and strokes his face; she tells the Aes Sedai that they have met their part of the bargain. Rand is promptly put back into his chest. Rand struggles to find the void as his thoughts race about how he can get himself and Min out of there. Lews Therin is ranting again, but Rand thinks that the two should work together; the voice of Lews Therin tells him, as Rand probes the shield, that if the women will tie off his shield, he knows how to break it. He will know it is tied off when the six points in the flows are hard, not soft like they are right now. While Rand tries to find a way through the shield, he thinks of various strategies that will get him out of the chest so that he has a better chance at escape. He begins to laugh and cannot stop."

Perrin stops at a boat that seems to have a crew and says that they want to cross the river, flashing some gold. The ferrymen agrees to take them across as soon as he can find oarsmen. Perrin thinks about Faile as they cross the river - she hadn't kissed him goodbye but her scent had been a confusing jumble of emotions. Once across the river, Perrin is in what used to be the granaries - they were burned in some rioting earlier. He is greeted by Havien Nurelle and Dobraine. They tell him that all is ready to go and they set out to find Rand. A mile out they are joined by Dobraine's five hundred men and two hundred Mayeners.\nAround midday, Rhuarc, Sulin, and Nandera join the group. They tell Perrin that they have five thousand spears plus one thousand Maidens. Rhuarc says that he had to forbid all the Maidens from coming, but he didn't want news of Rand's disappearance to become common among the Aiel for fear that the bleakness would claim even more. Amys and Sorilea join Perrin. Amys announces that there are ninety-four Wise Ones as well, all of whom can channel, with Sorilea leading them. Perrin says that the group will have to press hard if they have any hope of catching up with Rand. The group travels hard that day.\nThat night, Perrin seeks out the wolves with his mind. When he finds them, he asks if they have seen the Aes Sedai ahead of them. The wolves give him the Aes Sedai's position. Perrin asks how far it is and is told that they are about sixty to seventy miles ahead. The wolves ask Perrin why he wants to know. Perrin tells them they \"have caged Shadowkiller.\" The wolves are shocked and send a message to Perrin that they are coming to help. Perrin goes to sleep.\nThe group continues to travel for four days. Every night before talking with the wolves, Perrin talks with Loial. Loial tells Perrin what he knows of the Aes Sedai law about gentling men. Loial also talks a great deal about Erith and how beautiful she is. Tensions mount between the various groups during the trip. The Aiel don't trust the Cairhienin and vice versa. There is also tension between the Maidens and the siswai'aman. Nandera and Sulin come to physical blows over leadership of the Maidens. Sulin wins the physical fight but it is Nandera who remains the leader. Amys and Sorilea have a power struggle over who will direct the Wise Ones as well, but settle it themselves in favour of Sorilea.\nThe seventh day out of the city, Perrin receives a sending from a wolf named Half Tail - there is a party of humans a few miles to the west and riding in the same direction as Perrin. Perrin recognizes the visual of the banners the wolf sends him and he tells the leaders of the various groups that they will probably be joined shortly by some friends. An hour later a group of Two Rivers men (including Dannil and Ban) under Perrin's banner join the party. Several Aes Sedai, including Verin, Alanna and Merana, are also in the party. Perrin asks how they got here and the answer is essentially that Alanna used her bond with Rand to track him, although she doesn't say that - she just says that she knows how to find him.\nThe Aes Sedai ask Perrin why he is here when Rand is several days to the north. Perrin informs them that Rand has been kidnapped. Perrin tells them that they are welcome to join his group. Perrin leads the Emond's Fielders and the Aes Sedai back to his party. Alanna refuses to tell Perrin anything about how she tracked Rand. Perrin can smell that Bera and Kiruna are vying for leadership, although Merana is the alleged leader of the Salidar embassy. Perrin enjoys being reunited with Dannil, Ban and the others from Emond's Field.\nOn the tenth day after leaving the city, he receives a sending from the wolves that he must hurry.

He gasps as one turns hard - it has been tied off - and then a second and a third and a fourth. The last two points are still soft, so they are still being held. Rand decides that he cannot wait for the other two to be tied off. He feels at the hard points, finding gaps between the flows. He edges his way into a gap, slowly, and then he can feel the Source. Rand does something he can't quite explain next - he flexes what he had extended through the first knot as hard as he can and the barrier weakens. He hopes that the Aes Sedai don't catch on to what he's doing yet and he tries again. He goes through each knot, flexing and destroying them in turn.\nWhen only the two soft spots remain, Rand reaches for the Source and shatters the barrier; he embraces the source and uses Air to blast the chest to pieces out and away from him. His muscles, used to confinement, are slow to work but he uses the time to take stock of his surroundings. Rand becomes aware of three women near him - two unconscious on the ground, one screaming hysterically. Some distance away, Rand spots Min lying on the ground. He rushes toward her and turns her over; she is alive and relieved to see that he is unharmed. He unties her.\nRand sees Asha'man fighting and tells Min that Taim and others have come to rescue them. Rand tries to get Min to stay in the safe spot but she insists on coming with him into the battle. Rand spots Erian, his main torturer, and shields her. His eyes search out other Aes Sedai of Elaida's; he finds and shields Katerine and Sarene - one by one he shields the Aes Sedai. Soon, his efforts become obvious in that Perrin's Aiel are suffering few attacks made from the Power. The soldiers and Aiel warriors are still battling one another.\nGawyn rides up to Rand and Min and tells Min that he can get her out of there. Min tells him that she is staying and reminds Gawyn that Elayne loves Rand. Gawyn simply tells Jisao to rally the Younglings - they will cut a way out of the battle - and he rides off.\nTaim appears before Rand and Min just in time to stop a young Asha'man named Gedwyn from striking out at them. Taim tells Rand that he thought, under the circumstances, that Rand would not hold it against him for violating orders about confronting Aes Sedai. Rand refuses an offer of Healing from Taim. Lews Therin is ranting in Rand's head about killing Taim. Taim says he will have the campsite secure in a moment.\nA dome of Air covers the camp with only a small hole left in the top to let out the smoke. This blocks attacks of lightning and fire being hurled at the camp. The battle dies down inside the dome with defeated Shaido taking off their cadin'sor to become gai'shain. The shielded Aes Sedai are being held prisoner by the Asha'man. Alanna and the others do not approach Rand; he thinks that it is because of the Asha'man. Rand is not really surprised when Dobraine, Nandera, Perrin, Loial and Aram stagger up, wounded and bloody.\nPerrin is thankful that Rand is alive. Perrin tells him that they'd meant for him to make a gateway out but there is still too much confusion outside the dome for that to work. Rand orders that the dome of Air be lifted. Taim objects, saying that there are too many Shaido out there; he would rather wait to learn the place so they can make gateways out. Perrin tells Rand that as long as the dome is there and they don't know where Rand is, the Emond's Fielders and the Wise Ones won't stop attacking or leave. Loial suggest that two of them slip out of the dome and let the others know Rand is all right.\nRand rejects the ideas; he is determined to teach Sevanna a lesson. He orders Taim to show him the weapons he has made - to show him what the Asha'man can do. Taim agrees. Rand orders his banner to be raised through the hole in the dome, which an Asha'man named Grady does. Taim has the Asha'man form a battle line and then raise the Air dome barricade two spans. Shaido flood in; Taim orders the Asha'man to kill the Aiel. The Shaido explode in sprays of blood and flesh. Next Taim orders a \"rolling ring of Earth and Fire\", which causes the ground to erupt beneath the Shaido's feet, launching warriors in every direction. Rand orders a stop. The wounded and dead are everywhere, and the Shaido who have survived are fleeing. Rand congratulates Taim and the Asha'man and tells them that they have done well.\nThe Aes Sedai, including Bera, Kiruna and Alanna, finally come to greet Rand, telling him that he has done well. Rand coldly tells them that their place is with Elaida's emissaries, on their knees; he said that they could bring six Aes Sedai with them to meet him in Cairhien when they left Caemlyn, but they brought more. He orders them to kneel. Taim says that they must kneel and swear fealty to the Dragon Reborn or they will be knelt. The nine Aes Sedai from Salidar swear fealty to the Dragon Reborn."

She intends it to surpass the White Tower and does not care that this is not possible without Ogier Stonemasons or skill with using the Power for construction. She re-reads a report from Galina, telling her that Rand has been captured and shielded and thinks on how she will keep him safely locked up till Tarmon Gai'don and how her name will be greater than his in the histories.\nAlviarin arrives and tells her Elayne and Nynaeve are in Ebou Dar, posing as full sisters, which she does not believe until she is shown an artist's impression from the palace there. Elaida is irritated by her and considers it a shame that only six Sitters are under her control. She tells her to send Toveine Gazal and fifty other sisters to deal with the Black Tower. Alviarin warns against this, telling her of reports suggesting large numbers there, but she will not listen, refusing also to believe that Mazrim Taim, whose name has been forbidden from being mentioned, could also be there. In her anger and frustration, she mentions that only twenty-four men have been found in twenty years who could channel and is reminded that the chronicles record only sixteen. She tells Alviarin that she has no fear, but is in turn told of past Amyrlins who took on private penance. In her anger, she says any man found able to channel is to be hanged rather than brought back.\nFinally, Alviarin tells Elaida that the rebels are on the move and have chosen Egwene as their Amyrlin, clearly hoping to shock her. This only amuses her, however, as she reasons that it shows they are not serious, for if they were, one of the more ambitious sisters would have seen themselves named Amyrlin. She also believes that one hundred of them are ready to jump back and that she has her own secret plans working amongst them. She thinks she may only still a few of the more prominent sitters. Finally, she is taken by a Foretelling, and says that the White Tower will be whole again and stronger than ever, except for a few scorned outcasts, that Rand will face the Amyrlin and know her anger, and that the Black Tower will be rent and sisters will walk its grounds. She assumes this is proof of her success."

They also discuss what to do to at this point and decide to have Faolain and Theodrin ask questions about her maid's visitors in order to get information on the man that can channel who freed Moghedien.\nDuring Egwene's talk with Siuan and Leane she practices some of what Siuan taught her about being the Amyrlin Seat.\nAfter the talk Egwene decides to take a walk in order to tire herself so that she could sleep better, as she has been suffering from headaches. On her walk she passes by the area designated for Traveling and Skimming, just as a group of Aes Sedai and their Warders and servants come back from Salidar with information from their eyes-and-ears in the world. In the Skimming that Rand does, or that men do using saidin, one can encounter other men Skimming; but in the women's Skimming using saidar one cannot encounter another person skimming, unless they both start at precisely the same place and go to the same place.\nAs Egwene walks, she thinks on the rebel Aes Sedai having gained Talents that the White Tower thought lost forever, and discovered new ones. This should have made her feel better, but it didn't. She also thinks on a letter that arrived the day they left Salidar from the sisters that they sent to meet with Rand. The letter was worded like the majority of letters that nobles use mainly for playing the Great Game of Houses. Basically the letter was saying that everything was going well and that Verin and Alanna had found some girls who could be trained to become Aes Sedai. Alanna had bonded Rand, but Egwene doesn't realize that that is what is meant by \"Alanna has formed an attachment to the wool merchant which may prove useful, though it is troubling too.\" Egwene remembers that Sheriam thinks Egwene would be delighted to see her friends from home, although she isn't. She is more focused on how she is going to become known as the true Amyrlin Seat.\nDuring her walk, Leane joins her and Egwene takes off her stole, so it look like both her and Leane might be seen as Accepted in the night from a distance. Leane tells her that her questioners are out seeing what they can find. Leane talks with Egwene for a while, telling her not to go see Rand because it would ruin all the influence that she had gained in the Hall and make it so she had no free time. When Leane leaves, she possibly goes to get a new Warder since she says, \"In that case, Mother, if you will forgive me, there's a man in Lord Bryne's camp... After all, who ever heard of a Green without even one Warder?\"\nAs Egwene starts to return to her tent she is confronted by Nicola and Areina (both women who were on the boat with Nynaeve, Elayne, and Birgitte).

Next, she dreams of Mat and the Illuminators, and then of the headsman's axe falling on her while a would be rescuer runs to her. Then she dreams of Logain stepping over what looks like Rand's body, only for it to fall apart when she tries to touch it. She also dreams of a golden hawk linked to her, of a man dying while the world rejoices and mourns, though it is important he lives, and of other things."

She is disgusted with herself and thinks that she has found the true borders of her courage in Valda's bed. Breane and Lini enter her room, and Breane tells Morgase not to be a coward. Morgase is afraid that the men know what has happened, but Breane replies that she and Lini have not told them.\nTallanvor enters with Basel Gill and Lamgwin. Basel Gill tells the women that he saw something like a large bird landing on top of the South Barracks, and that people climbed off it. Lini is angry that they have disturbed Morgase over some bird, but then Tallanvor sees something land atop the North Barracks. Morgase goes to the window and sees yet another shape land, and people climb off it. She is convinced that it must be Shadowspawn.\nThere is a flash of light and a big boom, and Morgase knows that the One Power is being used. Now she thinks that it is Aes Sedai, but Tallanvor thinks that \"more likely it's some of those men, those Shamin or whatever they call themselves.\" He says that he can get Morgase outside the Fortress of the Light while there is so much commotion, but Lini refuses to let him take Morgase into the battle.\nSeanchan soldiers come for Morgase, but she doesn't know this as she has never before seen Seanchan. She is taken from her room, alone, and led to the audience chamber. On the way, she sees Taraboner soldiers as well, and is shocked. The High Lady Suroth greets her, and proceeds to tell her about damane. She also tells Morgase that the Seanchan have taken over Tarabon, and intend to do the same in Amadicia. Morgase replies that Tarabon was a divided nation, and that it will not be so easy for the Seanchan to take over the rest of the nations. Morgase is horrified when she discovers that one of the servants with Suroth is Amathera, the former Panarch of Tarabon, and one of the damane used to be Aes Sedai. Suroth tells Morgase that Morgase can rule Andor under the Empress, if she swears the Seanchan oaths, and then dismisses her.\nMorgase returns to her rooms and weighs her two options: she can aid the Seanchan in taking over Andor or she can rid Suroth of her leverage by jumping out the window and killing herself. She thinks, however, that the Queen of Andor should not die in such a manner, so she verbally relinquishes the throne: \"Under the Light, I relinquish the High Seat of House Trakand to Elayne Trakand. Under the Light, I renounce the Rose Crown and abdicate the Lion Throne to Elayne, High Seat of House Trakand. Under the Light, I submit myself to the will of Elayne of Andor, her obedient subject.\" Lini and Breane do not hear her. When they realize that she was thinking about suicide, the three of them begin to bicker.\nThe men return with Sebban Balwer, who was Pedron Niall's secretary until he died. Balwer tells Morgase that he can get them outside Amador. Seanchan allow remarkable freedom to those who swear their oaths and he has received a pass to take up to ten people from Amador; Morgase accepts his offer. Balwer gets them outside Amador, and Morgase wonders what kind of life she will make for herself without a throne.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

Perrin speaks with Loial and Karldin, who is an Asha'man. Loial is to visit all of the stedding to secure the Waygates. Rand even refuses to see Min.\nPerrin saddles Stepper and heads north where he meets with Faile, Aram, the Two Rivers men, the Aiel and two Asha'man who are to accompany him. There are also two Aes Sedai with the Aiel. Fager Neald opens a gateway and Jur Grady, the other Asha'man, goes through it followed by the Maidens, Perrin, Faile and Aram. Faile is also bringing several of the Cairhienin and Tairen youths who pretend to be Aiel. The Two Rivers men are next, and then the two Aes Sedai, followed by the remounts and the supply carts. Perrin wishes that Neald would close the gateway so as to stop the next group of people, but he knows he cannot: Berelain and her Winged Guards ride through.\nGoing to a slight rise so that everyone can hear him, Perrin tells everyone that as far as everyone back in Cairhien knows, the following is happening: He has been banished, Berelain is on her way home, and the rest of them have simply disappeared. He tells them that in actuality, they are now in Ghealdan and they have two tasks to accomplish. The first is convincing Alliandre, the Queen of Ghealdan, that they are not invaders. The second is to find Masema, the Prophet of the Dragon. Perrin prays that everything goes quickly and smoothly.

Despite the fact that he doesn't want to stay in the Tarasin Palace, he is very happy with his rooms; there is a large sitting room, a small sitting room, an immense bedchamber and a room for Nerim. There are arched windows, gilded stand-lamps, mirrors and even a clock. Tylin appears, and corners Mat. She sits on his lap and kisses him. He tries to dissuade her, but she won't listen. Juilin and Thom arrive, and Tylin quickly gets off Mat's lap before they see, and leaves. Juilin and Thom tell Mat that the girls are outside the palace.\nWhile waiting for Elayne and Nynaeve to return, Mat checks on Olver and his men. Upon returning, they tell him that they just went for a walk and had tea with some women that his innkeeper knows. Mat tells the girls that whenever they leave the palace, there will be two guards going with them. Much to his surprise, they do not argue at all. Elayne and Nynaeve have Mat, Nalesean, Thom and Juilin watch the Kin's house. They sit outside a tavern called The Rose of the Elbar, but nothing happens.\nWhen Mat returns to his rooms at the palace, there is a note from Tylin waiting for him. \"My little rabbit, I expect to have you for dinner tonight in my apartments\". He locks his door and goes to bed. Tylin tries the door and laughs when she finds that it is locked. Mat does not sleep well that night. The next morning, he arranges to have Olver moved into his rooms since he is sure that Tylin will not try anything with a boy watching them. He spends the next two days outside the Kin's house. Birgitte joins them and she and Mat begin to develop a friendship.\nTylin has the cooks not give him any food, saying that he must not ruin his appetite for his dinner with the Queen. She also leaves him another note. He begins buying his own food, and after one night with no note slipped under his door, he begins to think that things might turn out for the better.

Merilille tells her that she has endangered a secret that is sworn to the shawl. Vandene and Adeleas side with Merilille; Careane argues that Elayne \"cannot be faulted for revealing a secret she did not know\"; Sareitha argues that Tower law doesn't allow for mere excuses, and Careane ends up agreeing with her. Sareitha suggests that Elayne and Nynaeve be confined to the palace, given chores to do, and be given a firm dose of the slipper at regular intervals. Elayne is confused, and wonders aloud if this secret deals with the Kin. Merilille interrupts, and suggests passing sentence. The others agree.\nPol, Merilille's maid, has a letter for Elayne, who takes it before the other Aes Sedai can react. It is from Jaichim Carridin, saying that Morgase is alive and is currently a guest of Pedron Niall in Amador. Elayne is furious; she thinks that Carridin is lying and mocking her. She channels and burns the letter.\nMerilille tells Elayne to release the Source because she was not given permission to channel. Elayne orders Pol to leave, and she does. Merilille demands to know what has gotten into her, and threatens to fetch a slipper immediately. Elayne is even more furious now, and intends for the others to recognize both Nynaeve and herself as Aes Sedai just as they recognize Egwene al'Vere as Amyrlin. Elayne informs the others that they will take their orders from her and Nynaeve now, and no one argues. Adeleas and Vandene proceed to tell Elayne about the Kin.\nThe Kin began during the Trolloc Wars. Runaways and those who were put out of the Tower would flee to Barashta, which is now Ebou Dar. Many would become Healers or Wisdoms. While the Kin always make sure to remain hidden, they will sometimes pass on word to Aes Sedai when a woman is found pretending to be Aes Sedai. The Kin help runaways, and it is because of this that the White Tower has never broken up the Kin; when a woman runs away, they know exactly where to look.\nAdeleas and Vandene finish, and Elayne stands. She is surprised when the others follow suit. She is told that when another Aes Sedai stands above or is placed above others, other Aes Sedai will tend to follow her rather meekly. They all sit again, and Elayne proceeds to tell them what she knows of the Kin."

He is surprised to be alive and tells them that the dagger Fain used came from Shadar Logoth. Cadsuane tells him that he has been ill for two days and must rest. Dashiva offers to clear the women from the room, preparing the weaves to do so. Rand tells him not to do so, gets dressed, and tells them that he needs to speak to the Asha'man alone. Min tells him of a viewing wherein Cadsuane has something she needs to teach all the Asha'man and that they will not like learning it. Rand learns that Weiramon has pushed ahead on his own and realizes that he must enact his plans. He tells them that they are to help him kill Sammael. Min agrees to distract the Maidens and Wise Ones so he can get away.\nThey Travel to the Saldaean camp where Bashere has been training the men who could not channel, calling them the Legion of the Dragon. Rand tells them it is time and that he wants no women. Bashere agrees, which angers Deira. Rand weaves a gateway between two posts to the Square of Tammaz in Illian and the horsemen flood through. Once inside Illian, he Travels the short distance to one of the towers in the palace and directs flows of Power in all directions to trigger any wards or traps Sammael had set. He leaves the tower as it explodes, sustaining an injury in the process, then follows the source of that weave. Sammael taunts him, asking if he has the courage to follow him. Not wanting to kill any innocents, Rand opens a gateway close to one that Sammael used, to Shadar Logoth. At first, he suspects Sammael of having lured him there and left; but he sees Trollocs and realizes that he must still be present. Suddenly, they are attacked by Liah, who seems ready to attack him until she recognizes him and flees. After killing more Trollocs with a Power-wrought sword, lightning comes, almost striking him and knocking him to the ground. A man appears, helping him stand and not identifying himself. Rand tries to balefire Mashadar, but the man does the same. The bars cross, shattering the Void and causing him to lose saidin; he sees double. The man seems to know how Sammael thinks and makes Rand realize that he is likely to be at the Waygate around which Rand had set wards. The man leaves, saying many plans will have to be relaid if Rand dies. After he leaves, Rand realizes that he never felt saidin in him.\nAt the Waygate, he sees Sammael. Before he can strike, he also sees Liah touched by Mashadar and he balefires her to save her from that death. He sweeps the bar past where Sammael was. Afterwards, Rand assumes Sammael must be dead as he didn't feel him escape and was weak enough to be killed if Sammael had survived. He Skims back to Illian, mourning Liah and unable to cry. Lord Gregorin, speaking on behalf of the Council of Nine, offers him the crown. He says that Brend had most likely killed Mattin. Rand asks why and is told it is partly because of the grain Rand sent from Tear that kept the commoners fed. He places the Laurel Crown on Rand's head, proclaiming him, as Rand feels swords on the crown prick him."

She thinks to herself that if the White Tower would not or could not do what must be done, then someone must, and that it is no use to guard the Blight while the world crumbles behind her. Riding at her other side is Lord Baldhere, her Swordbearer. She asks if he has any qualms, and he replies that he does not like having to hide who he is.\nEthenielle, Serailla and Baldhere meet with Paitar Nachiman and Easar Togita, the kings of Arafel and Shienar. Each has with him two attendants; Paitar has brought Ishigari Terasian and Kyril Shianri, and Easar has brought Agelmar Jagad and Alesune Chulin. Ethenielle asks if they have managed to come this far without detection, and Easar replies, \"If we've been seen, Ethenielle, then we might as well turn back now.\"\nThe fourth Borderland ruler, Tenobia Kazadi of Saldaea informs them that she will not turn back until Davram Bashere and Rand al'Thor learn exactly who rules Saldaea. She has only one attendant with her, Kalyan Ramsin, who is one of her uncles. Easar and Paitar assure Tenobia that they, too, do not mean to turn back while Ethenielle ponders on the strange nature of Saldaeans. She thinks to herself that Tenobia is young, with a temper like a wildfire. She thinks that Tenobia needs to be married, though she doubts that this will ever happen.\nEthenielle tunes back into the conversation when she hears mentions of Aes Sedai. Ethenielle is immediately alarmed, thinking to herself that, \"if Aes Sedai had gained a hint of their plan...well, Aes Sedai always had plans of their own.\" It seems that Paitar has brought his Aes Sedai advisor, Coladara. Not only that, but Coladara had seven visiting Aes Sedai that she brought with her. Paitar says that he thought it prudent, under the circumstances, to bring them. Ethenielle is quite aghast, thinking that if there are eight Aes Sedai with them, then surely the White Tower knows every move they intend. As if that were not bad enough, Tenobia announces that she has also brought five Aes Sedai whom she ran into before leaving Saldaea. Ethenielle tells them that all any of the thirteen Aes Sedai need to do is find a way to send a short message to the Tower, and asks if any of them can stop the Aes Sedai. Paitar replies that the dice are out of the cup. Easar adds that, further south, it may be well to have Aes Sedai with them.\nTenobia invites the other three to dine with her that night, and adds to Ethenielle that her uncle, Kalyan, would be honored to sit beside her. For a moment, Ethenielle is outraged at the idea of Tenobia trying to set her up with her uncle. She looks at Kalyan and sees something that she has not seen for a long time - a man looking at a woman, not a queen.\nThey slash their left palms and grip them together, swearing that they are one to the death. Ethenielle thinks that now, all they have to do is find Rand al'Thor and do what must be done, whatever the price."

              "pov_summary": "Verin is sitting in a tent with Turanna, an Aes Sedai of the White Ajah who was captured by the Asha'man at Dumai's Wells. Verin speaks briefly outside the tent to Coram and Mendan, the two Aiel men who have been set to \"guide\" her. She thinks of the size of the camp, the Aes Sedai who have been named \"da'tsang\", and the Aes Sedai such as Kiruna, who haven't.\nVerin asks Coram to tell Colinda, one of the Wise Ones, that she is done with Turanna and would like to see Katerine Alruddin. While she waits, she sees Irgain, one of the Aes Sedai who was stilled by Rand. Feeling sick, Verin returns to her tent and tries absentmindedly to comfort Turanna.\nTwo Wise Ones, Daviena and Losaine, enter the tent. They link and assume Turanna's shield before leading her from the tent. Aeron, another Wise One, arrives. She flips through Verin's notebook, but sees nothing about the questions that Verin is supposed to be asking the other Aes Sedai. Verin replies that they all pretty much say the same thing; \"The Car'a'carn was to be housed in the Tower until the Last Battle. His...um...mistreatment...began because of an escape attempt. But you know that already, of course. Never fear though; I'm sure I will learn more.\"\nTwo Maidens enter with Beldeine Nyram, an Aes Sedai of the Green Ajah. Verin is slightly alarmed, since she asked for Katerine Alruddin; she thinks that what she has been doing and intends to do is very tiring, and she doesn't think that she can do it if any of the Aes Sedai that she \"questions\" have Warders. Luckily, Beldeine has none. Tialin, the Wise One that entered with the Maidens and Beldeine, replies that Katerine Alruddin has escaped. Verin is instructed by Aeron not to tell Rand. After she and Beldeine are alone, Verin begins to speak with her. Beldeine is angry that Verin could have so easily sworn an oath of fealty to Rand. Verin very clearly reminds Beldeine of her position as \"da'tsang\", and Beldeine loses her vehemence.\nVerin offers Beldeine Healing, and she accepts. Verin Heals her, and then while Beldeine is still vulnerable, begins another weave, using an angreal that she has had for many years. The weave is very intricate, using all of the Five Powers, especially Spirit. Beldeine drowsily asks what Verin is doing, and Verin replies that what she is doing will not harm Beldeine. Verin then thinks to herself that this is true; the weave itself will not harm Beldeine, but she might die as a result of it in the years to come.\nSo as not to make anyone who might be listening suspicious, Verin begins to ask Beldeine a few questions about Rand. While Beldeine talks, Verin continues to think to herself. Many of the wilders who go to the Tower have their own little tricks that tend to fall under two categories: A way to listen in on other people's conversations, or a way of making people do as they wanted. The Tower cares little about the first, but more about the second, since it is akin to Compulsion. Verin has questioned these girls over the years and slowly pieced their stories together, even though the Tower forbids anything like it.\nFinally, Verin is done. She pulls on two of four weaves of Spirit, and the whole, intricate weave partially collapses. She then gives Beldeine instructions, and pulls on the remaining two weaves of Spirit, causing the weave to settle in to Beldeine. What Verin has done is not \"true\" Compulsion as the ancient texts describe it. It is a very slow and painful process, and also requires trust on the part of the object of the weave. Beldeine, who began to convulse as the weave collapsed, finally quietens. Verin lets her believe that she fainted, and then tells Coram and Mendan, that she is done. Even though there are still several hours left in the day, Verin is exhausted. However, she thinks that she can handle one more and asks that Irgain be brought to her. She tells herself that she has to keep Rand alive until it is time for him to die."

He occasionally strokes one of the two mindtraps that hang on cords around his neck. His attention is on a game board that is before him. There are thirty-three red pieces, and thirty-three green pieces, arrayed across a playing surface of thirteen squares by thirteen. It is a recreation of a once-famous game named sha'rah that only nine living people even remember; he had been a master of it. The first object of the game is to capture the Fisher, which is the most important piece. Only then does the game really begin. The Fisher on Moridin's board is still in its starting position.\nA servant with dead black eyes approaches and offers Moridin wine. He takes it, but does not drink. His attention is held by the Fisher. It is the only piece in the game whose attributes alter according to where it stands. If the Fisher is on a white square, it is weak in attack, yet agile and far-ranging in escape. If it is on a black square, it is strong in attack, yet slow and vulnerable. When the game is played by masters, the Fisher will change sides many times throughout the game. There is a green-and-red goal-row that surrounds the playing surface; only the Fisher can move onto it, but it is not safe even there. The Fisher is never safe. The easiest way to victory is to move the Fisher to a square of your color behind your opponent's end of the board. When your opponent has the Fisher, you try to leave him no choice but to move the Fisher onto a square of your color. Holding the Fisher can be more dangerous than not. Another way to victory is by the complete annihilation of your enemy. Moridin has tried this way once, but it failed painfully.\nMoridin is suddenly filled with fury. He reaches for the True Power. His hand closes around the two mindtraps, and he nearly crushes the Fisher to dust with the True Power. His goblet shatters, and he nearly crushes the mindtraps. He thinks about how the Fisher is always worked as a man with a bandage around his eyes and a few drops of blood dripping through his fingers. The reason for this has been lost, and Moridin is often enraged about the knowledge that might be lost in the turnings of the Wheel, knowledge that he needs and to which he has a right.\nHe sets the Fisher back on the board and releases the mindtraps. There is no need for destruction yet. He thinks that perhaps the Fisher comes from a dim memory of Rand al'Thor. He realizes that he is laughing, but does not attempt to stop. On his board, the Fisher is waiting to be moved, but in the greater game, al'Thor is already moving to his wishes. Moridin thinks how it is very hard to lose a game when you played both sides of the board. He is now laughing so hard that there are tears rolling down his face."

Nynaeve feels she has to warn Teslyn but the more experienced sister dismisses Nynaeve's warning about the storm that is not a storm, the gholam, the Black Ajah and the Forsaken as fancies of a girl who should not be playing at being Aes Sedai.\nFinally reaching the group of Sea Folk Windfinders, the remains of the Knitting circle, and a few Aes Sedai jealously guarding the Bowl of Winds waiting for them in the stable yard, they are ready to leave the city.

The Kin are nervous around Aes Sedai, the Sea Folk are impatient to get on with the job at hand so they can get their hands on the Bowl of the Winds, and the Aes Sedai want to put Ispan to the question as soon as possible.\nElayne decides to direct her attention to something she can do before everybody is ready to move.

Slowly a larger pile of rubbish and a smaller of useful objects form. Elayne even finds an angreal, even if it is not a particularly strong one. She keeps that for herself.\nVandene comes over to lecture Elayne on the dangers of studying Power related objects. More than one woman has killed or burnt herself out doing so. Elayne insists that she knows what she is doing even if Vandene manages to shake her confidence a bit.\nThe conversation comes to an abrupt end when Merilille screams.

The others dismiss this as Aviendha having seen a nosy servant. A bit later, when they leave for the Kin's farm, Aviendha tells Elayne about seeing the person in a sister-to-sister chat.

Moridin dismisses those stories. The news about this so-called Bowl of Winds is more disturbing though. One of the surprising talents of these primitives is their ability to control the weather on a scale nobody in the age of legends had been able to achieve without the help of a ter'angreal. The Great Lord of the Dark had put much effort in freezing the seasons in place. This effort must not be undone.\nRage envelops Moridin as he reaches for the True Power.

Elayne convinces her that Aviendha hasn't failed anybody and fear is something Elayne herself feels as well. Elayne hands Aviendha one of the angreal to use in the circle they are about to form.\nBefore they start, Nynaeve approaches Elayne and asks her to let her know when she is making a fool of herself over Lan. She even apologizes to Elayne. Elayne tells her to pull herself together. Nynaeve also receives an angreal.\nReanne starts calling the Sea Folk women who will be part of the circle. The details of ranks among the Sea Folk still elude Elayne. Reanne puts Caire din Gelyn Running Wave in charge, something she considers a victory over another Windfinder. Caire assumes command by delivering an extraordinarily arrogant speech. She then orders Nynaeve to explain Linking to the rest of the circle.\nRenaile seems to think that Linking is dangerous. One of the Aes Sedai states that it is not dangerous in order to convince her. One by one the women join the circle until a full thirteen are linked. Caire then tears the control of the circle away from Elayne and starts using the Bowl of the Winds. Elayne sees that it would takes many years of study to affect the weather like Caire is doing. She also notes that the Bowl of Winds uses both halves of the source, a very disturbing thought for the women in the circle. Caire releases the source without warning when she is done, a thoroughly unpleasant experience to the other women in the circle.\nThe weather hasn't notably changed, but Caire claims to have been successful. It will take a while for their efforts to take effect. The Sea Folk demand that the Aes Sedai now fulfil their part of the bargain. Nynaeve tells them she will be convinced it worked when the weather changes.\nThe women become aware of channeling on a large scale in the direction of the city of Ebou Dar. So much Power cannot be wielded even by one of the Forsaken. Nynaeve wants to go back to Ebou Dar to get Mat but Elayne tells her no. After what they just did none of them are capable of channeling much. Mat will have to take care of himself. Nynaeve is astounded that Elayne would leave him. Aviendha agrees with her near sister; there is too much at stake.\nAt that moment the first raken is seen in the sky. The Seanchan are attacking Ebou Dar. They will have to move quickly to avoid becoming damane. Elayne tells the Sea Folk that their half of the bargain isn't fulfilled as long as the weather hasn't changed and that they are to follow her to Caemlyn to see the bargain through.

Elayne frets a bit over the ter'angreal that have been packed while she has been absent. She realizes her concern is more that she considers them to be hers than there being any reason for concern.\nThe group gets ready to move quickly. Elayne opens a gateway to a meadow not far from one of the manor houses the Trakand family owns. The Sea Folk, the Kin and the Aes Sedai pour through. Elayne picked one of the more isolated estates as a destination. It's only two weeks of travel from Caemlyn. She hopes to get to the capital and claim the Lion Throne before anybody realizes she is in Andor.\nAfter everybody has passed through the gateway, one problem remains. Elayne doesn't want to take the chance that one of the Seanchan damane can read the residue and discovers how to Travel. She tries to unravel her weave. The others protest saying that it is too dangerous. To cut the discussion short Elayne picks out the first threads. There is no going back now; she will have to finish it. Nynaeve and Alise lead the others to the manor with a message from Elayne. Birgitte and Aviendha stay with her. After some advice from Aviendha, Elayne starts. Halfway through, the Seanchan arrive at the other side of the gateway. They send soldiers and channelers. Birgitte and Aviendha hold them back as well as they can while Elayne works. Both get hit by arrows.\nFinally Elayne realizes that she can't hold the weave much longer. The three of them retreat behind a rise and Elayne lets go of the weave. The explosion that follows kills all of the Seanchan on the Andoran side of the gateway and a large number on the other side. The three women are wounded and their horses are killed or gone. Aviendha explains some things about unraveling a weave that Elayne didn't know. It is very unpredictable what happens when a weave collapses. They could have been stilled; but it could also have been just a loud bang. Elayne realizes what a risk Aviendha took by staying by her side.

Bashere says they will do better next time. Rand thinks they will have to or he'll run out of men.\nBashere's patrols bring in the prisoners, about a hundred men. To make matters worse there is also one woman among them, a sul'dam. Rand decides to let the men go but hand the sul'dam over to the Aes Sedai later. When she hears this the sul'dam, Nerith, goes mad. It takes four men to subdue her. One of the soldiers reports the next group of Seanchan have been spotted. On to the next battle."

They object at leaving him unguarded but Rand says he can take care of himself. After the two leave a group of several hundred Seanchan heads in their direction. Rand is not in a good position to fight here. He loses control of the Source and falls off his horse. Surrounded by nobles of questionable loyalty to him, he is vulnerable now. The nobles seem more worried that Bashere might hang them if something happens to him than with Rand's condition. They order their troops to give it all they've got. Bashere and a group of Companions return in time to turn the battle.\nAfter it is done Bashere tells him all the Seanchan are heading west. He's defeated them.

She tells him she asked Moridin for a replacement for Jaichim, one of the two prisoners. She kills Jaichim in front of Hanlon by pouring a large quantity of brandy down his throat. Hanlon doesn't know who Moridin is or Jaichim for that matter but his orders came from Moghedien herself so he had better be careful.\nThe other prisoner is an Aes Sedai named Falion. She apparently failed this Moridin in some way too. She gets the same treatment as Jaichim but is allowed to live. For the moment. After this rather elaborate reminder of the price of failure Shiaine explains what she wants Hanlon to do. It seems his next mission involves a Queen. That is something Hanlon hasn't laid his hands on yet.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

They have been in the care of the Wise Ones for a while and are now ready to serve the Dragon Reborn. Rand asks them why and they each have their own reasons. Min has a viewing that each of the women, including Sorilea, will serve Rand in her own way. Whatever that may mean. Rand accepts if they are willing to swear fealty like some of the other sisters did. The five promptly do and Rands tells Sorilea to put them with the others who have sworn fealty.\nAfter they leave Rand decides it is time to find out what Cadsuane wants. He asks Min to join him, maybe she'll have a viewing. Min doesn't want to leave him out of her sight anyway so she accepts. They have just left the throne room when a massive blast hits the palace. The throne room they have left just moments earlier is reduced to rubble. Rand gives Morr orders to take Min to a safe place and guard her with his life. Morr assures Min he will take care of her.

Pevara is adamant; Talene tried to stab them to escape and is therefore guilty. They bring her awake before the Trollocs in her dream can put her in the cookpot.\nOnce awake, Pevara demands that Talene forswear the oaths that bind her and retake the Three Oaths. Under threat of being placed back in the dream, Talene takes the Oath Rod and forswears all oaths that bind her and begins to howl. They make her re-swear the Three Oaths and a fourth, to obey the four of them absolutely. She admits to being Black Ajah. When told that they intend to tell Elaida, she tells them Elaida herself is Black Ajah and that the Black Ajah knows her every plan and every decision days before it is announced.

She decides to hire mercenaries and Hunters for the Horn, something Dyelin disapproves of, as does Birgitte, as mercenaries' loyalty and consistency cannot be counted on. Elayne explains that crime is rising and they need to keep it under control themselves now that the Saldaeans have left and the Aiel are leaving. She tells them that she wants the Guards built up to be the largest army in the land, something that appalls Dyelin as she worries that it could turn people against her. Again Elayne is forced to explain; if she does not fight, her opponents will anyway and she must be able to match them.\nThey are interrupted by the arrival of Renaile, Zaida and Merilille. Elayne tells them that she will see them later that day, but they refuse, both thinking that it is her they are trying to avoid. Zaida tells her she is to fulfil the terms of the bargain, giving them teachers in addition to Merilille. Elayne suggests they go to Tear to the Sea Folk gathered there instead, but they decline, with Zaida saying that she wants to wait in case Rand turns up. She suggests that some of the other Aes Sedai might teach, an idea that Merilille welcomes with enthusiasm. Elayne gives a noncommittal reply, saying that \"Something may be worked out, if the Light pleases\", which Zaida takes as an actual agreement.\nReene arrives to tell them that Mazrim Taim is there. Elayne is in the process of instructing her that he is to wait and be given the third best wine, when he walks into the room. She seizes saidar, as do the others, but Taim only notices the two Aes Sedai. Elayne insults him by calling him \"Master Taim\", but he is not baited, settling for calling her \"Mistress Elayne\" in response, which angers Dyelin. He tells her he has a gift for her. She tells him that she will ally with the Dragon Reborn in time, but that Andor is not a conquered nation and that if Rand objects she will deal with him. His mouth quirks and she realizes that calling Rand by his first name was an error. She complains about him walling in four miles of Andor for the Black Tower. She tells him she won't try to force her way in, but that she can isolate the Black Tower, so that the Asha'man must Travel to buy food. He is momentarily annoyed, but replies that as she can only control a small area, they wouldn't need to Travel far. He accedes to controlled visits, telling her he wouldn't want any accidents. She accepts this but before they can argue further, Nadere arrives to tell her it is time for the First Sister ceremony.\nElayne agrees to strip and Taim commands his Asha'man to turn round. She asks Nadere how they summoned Aviendha for the ceremony, as nudity would not have bothered her, but is told that that is for Aviendha to reveal. Once in the room where the ceremony is to take place, Monaelle takes charge. Viendre stands for Elayne's mother and Tamela for Aviendha's. Amys comes forward to accept the pangs of birth.\nThey are asked a series of questions by Monaelle and each of them answers:\n1) What is the best you know of the other woman.\nElayne: \"Aviendha is so confident, so proud, she doesn't care what anyone thinks she should do, or be; she is who she wants to be.\"\nAviendha: \"Even when Elayne is so afraid that her mouth dries, her spirit will not bend. She is braver than anyone I have ever known.\"\nElayne is astonished that Aviendha could think that, but from Aviendha's own look, she is equally surprised. Viendra tells Elayne that courage is good, but that one day it will leave her weeping in the dust as her spine turns to jelly. She nods in agreement. Aviendha is told that she is totally controlled by ji'e'toh because she cares to her bones what everyone thinks of her. She agrees with this, but Elayne feels that this is twisting things.\n2) They are then asked what they find worst in each other.\nElayne: \"Aviendha...She...she thinks violence is always the answer. At times she won't think beyond her belt knife. At times she's like a boy who won't grow up!\"\nAviendha: \"Elayne knows that...She knows she is beautiful, knows the power it gives her over men. She exposes half her bosom sometimes in the open air and she smiles to make men do what she wants.\"\nThey are both offended, but mollified a little when the Wise Ones make them realize each also has the same weakness.\n3) They are asked of the most childish thing in the other woman.\nThis is something that Elayne thinks is much easier to answer.\nElayne: \"Aviendha won't let me teach her to swim. I've tried. She isn't afraid of anything except getting into more water than a bathtub.\"\nAviendha: \"Elayne gobbles sweets with both hands like a child who escaped her mother's eye. If she keeps on she will be as fat as a pig before she grows old.\"\nMonaelle seems amused by this, but neither Elayne nor Aviendha are.\n4) Finally, they are asked what is their greatest jealousy of the other woman.\nElayne thinks about how she could have put forward minor jealousies, but Avhiendha's previous two answers have hardened her resolve\nElayne: \"Aviendha has lain in the arms of the man I love. I never have; I may never and I could weep over it!\"\nAviendha: \"Elayne has the love of Rand al'Th...of Rand. My heart is dust for wanting him to love me, but I do not know if he ever will.\"\nAviendha is told to strike Elayne as hard as she can with her open hand and does so before Elayne has a chance to react. Elayne is then told to do the same and hits Aviendha hard, despite telling herself that she will not. They are then told to do the same with the other hand and they obey. After this, they are told that they may leave and that many do, but if they still wish to be first sisters, they should embrace, which they do, asking each other for forgiveness. Monaelle tells them that they will find themselves angry with each other in the future, but to remember that they have already struck one other. She also tells them that they will always have toh towards each other, as all first siblings do. She says they will be born again and Elayne feels saidar being woven and begins to lose sense of the world. When she regains it, she can feel the sense of Aviendha in her head, like the Warder bond in some ways, but unlike it in others."

The men are suspicious but concede that they might have been frightened off by the fighting.\nLogain orders Toveine and Gabrelle inside, to her relief, as she does not like seeing the Traitor's Tree. Gabrelle tells her that Logain is the only full Asha'man to live in the village and that he found and burned her instructions that all the Asha'man were to be stilled and hanged where they were found. She also says that there are at least two factions, Taim's and Logain's, and men who don't even know there are factions.

Perrin is glad he did not let Faile come with him to Masema\u2019s camp. Perrin returns to his horses, where Elyas Machera and several Asha'man are guarding them. Elyas tells Perrin he thought they would have to fight their way out of the camp for a while. Perrin says that\u2019s the only thing that didn't go wrong today. Masema refuses to Travel to Cairhien, even at Rand\u2019s command; Masema believes it blasphemy for anyone but Rand to touch the One Power. Masema will go to Rand, but he and his followers will march the whole four hundred leagues.\nElyas says they could just incapacitate Masema, fight their way clear of his camp and then take him to Rand. Perrin acknowledges that\u2019s an option, but he does not want Abila to become a butcher\u2019s yard. Perrin\u2019s thoughts turn to Faile \u2014 he is getting used to her strange Saldaean ways. He thinks fondly of how she trims his beard for him.\nMasuri and Seonid return to the horses. Masuri tells Perrin that Masema is rabid and must be killed. Perrin tells her that she could choose a better place to say something like that; he doesn\u2019t want to hear arguments right now. Edarra and Carelle return and the Wise Ones say that Masema\u2019s camp is no place for talking; they order Masuri and Seonid to their horses. Everyone mounts their horses and they ride out of Abila.\nAfter they are out of the city, Balwer approaches Perrin with news that he thinks Perrin will be interested in. Elyas and Aram, who had been riding with Perrin, fall back to give them privacy. The first piece of news is that King Ailron battled the Seanchan at Jeramel about one hundred miles west of Abila ten days ago. The report is that the Amadician army is dead, captive or scattered and that Ailron was taken prisoner. Perrin takes the news in stride, noting that this means the Seanchan will be able to sweep through Amadicia too and that he should move east as quickly as possible. Balwer then tells him that the Whitecloaks took part in the battle but Eamon Valda got most of them off the field at the end; no one knows where those Whitecloaks have gone. Balwer tells Perrin they probably moved this direction, east, away from the Seanchan. Perrin says that the Whitecloaks are probably more interested in escaping the Seanchan than harming them.\nThe second piece of news is that the Seanchan fought a battle in southern Altara against Aes Sedai or men who could channel. Balwer reports that whoever they fought, the Seanchan lost and were sent reeling back into Ebou Dar. Perrin says this is good news and has a brief flashback to the fighting at Dumai's Wells. Perrin thinks of Faile and orders everyone to pick up the pace. He wants to reach Faile and resolves not to shout at her today.\n<< Prologue | Next Chapter >>"

              "pov_summary": "Perrin and the others ride into their camp and see the Mayener and Ghealdanin soldiers standing opposite to one another, apparently ready to fight at the drop of a hat. Perrin gallops up and finds Berelain, Gallenne, Annoura and Gerard Arganda all standing there\u2014looking upset. Before Perrin can demand to know what happened, Berelain tells Perrin that she and Faile were hunting with Alliandre and they were attacked by Aiel. Berelain managed to escape but no one else has returned yet. She has sent a squad of lancers south to scout and they will return with news by nightfall.\nPerrin is shocked \u2014 Faile has been captured! He demands to know why they are still here, in the camp, and not out searching for her. Berelain responds that they do not know how many Aiel there are \u2014 if they pursue there may be a battle that costs them many soldiers. She says they don\u2019t even know if the Aiel nearby are the ones that have Faile or even if Faile is alive. Berelain insists they must know that first before doing anything else.\nElyas agrees with Berelain. He tells Perrin that they will find Faile. Elyas says that the Mayeners may find traces but he will scout himself and will find more than that. Perrin agrees and tells Elyas to go and to hurry. Elyas leaves and after a moment, Aram follows him. Masuri and Seonid send their three Warders as well, for which Perrin is grateful.\nGerard Arganda, Alliandre\u2019s First Captain, pushes forward and speaks to Perrin, but Perrin does not hear what he\u2019s saying. He reaches out to find the wolves and pleads with them to help him find Faile. The wolves mourn Perrin\u2019s loss but will not get involved; there are so many humans about that the wolves do not know of the Aiel that Perrin seeks. As the wolves fade, Arganda demands to know whether Perrin is listening; Arganda is concerned about finding his Queen. Perrin coldly informs him that they will find Alliandre when they find Faile. Perrin asks Arganda to explain himself \u2014 why are the Ghealdanin drawn up and ready to attack? Arganda says it is Aiel that took Alliandre and there are Aiel in the camp; he wants them put to questioning. Berelain says that Arganda is overwrought and she has tried to explain to him that these are not the same Aiel. Perrin angrily says that Alliandre swore fealty to him and that makes him Arganda\u2019s lord. Arganda is to question no one and touch no one without Perrin\u2019s permission. He orders Arganda to take his men back to his camp now.\nBerelain murmurs that he handled that well and reaches out to touch him. Perrin snaps at her and says he has no patience for her games. Berelain is hurt; she rides off with Gallenne. Annoura calls Perrin a fool but Perrin has no idea what she is talking about. Perrin rides to his tent. Dannil Lewin informs him that he had gathered the Two Rivers folk and the Aiel in at sign of trouble from the Ghealdanin. Dannil says if the Mayeners hadn't arrived, they probably would have attacked. Perrin tells him he did a good job; Perrin says to tell one in three of the men to stay and guard the camp but the others need to pack up and be ready to ride as soon as there is news of Faile. Perrin goes to Gaul and the Aiel and begs them to find Faile; they relax upon hearing this, as it is clear Perrin does not believe they had anything to do with Faile\u2019s capture. The Aiel say they will find her if she still lives \u2014 they will move quickly, even in the snow. The Aiel begin to leave the camp, each pausing to comfort Perrin on their way out.\nGrady and Neald offer their services to Perrin as well. They can cover a lot of ground by Traveling. Perrin is tempted to accept their offer but remembers that they were not country men before becoming Asha'man; they know little of tracking and probably would not be able to tell him which direction they had traveled. Perrin tells them quietly just to pack and stay here\u2014they may be needed. Perrin goes to the Wise One\u2019s tent, and finding it tied, is about to rip open the ties when Nevarin comes out. He asks her what will be done with Faile. She doesn't know\u2014taking wetlanders captive is against custom. Perrin is about to argue but she tells him not to become irrational. She says that if he cannot control his thoughts he should get drunk; but he must not bother them when they are in council. Perrin walks to his tent and finds Basel Gill and Lini setting everything in order to leave. There is nothing for him to do so he walks up to a ridge where he can see the tracks of Elyas and the other scouts. He finds Tallanvor there as well. They stand on the ridge until darkness falls\u2014silent, waiting and watching.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

She hardly thinks about Perrin, except to hope he finds out Masema\u2019s secret dealings, because she is more worried about freezing. She is naked and struggling to keep up with the Shaido. There is a small chance anyone could surprise them as they are always alert. She wonders why the Shaido have not traded their green, gray and brown cadin'sor for white that would blend them into the snow. She tries to notice everything so that it can help her when she plans her escape.\nFaile tries to look back at her fellow prisoners but ends up falling into the snow. Rolan hauls her out by her hair, slaps her bottom and makes her move even faster. Faile thinks that despite being naked, Rolan does not look at her as a man looks at a woman; she is not sure how she feels about that. Faile continues marching for hours, worrying about which parts of her body will freeze off first. Her feet begin to leave bloody stains in the snow and she worries about frostbite, so she tries to wiggle her fingers and toes as much as possible. She keeps moving until she runs into Rolan. Rolan lifts her up and carries her over his shoulder.\nFaile looks back at Alliandre, Maighdin, Bain, Chiad, Arrela and Lacile. Alliandre and Maighdin are struggling, Bain and Chiad seem no worse off than the Shaido and Arrela and Lacile are trying to act like the Maidens with indifferent success. They are all being picked up and carried as well. Alliandre and Maighdin try to fight off the Aiel who are picking them up. Faile calls out to them to let themselves be carried and to obey her. Rolan tells Faile to be quiet and spanks her. Maighdin continues to resist but eventually both she and Alliandre are placed face down in the snow and switched. Both women resist, telling the Aiel they cannot do this to them; the switching continues\u200b until they are both kicking and howling. Faile has no sympathy for them\u2014they earned every stripe. It\u2019s obvious the Shaido are taking them to someplace with shelter and they need to get there.\nAs they set off through the forest, the Aiel are moving quickly. Faile is jostled and tries to find a more comfortable position to be in. Rolan tells her to be still and pats her hip. This makes Faile think a delay might not be such a bad thing if she could bite a chunk out of her captor. She recognizes the thoughts as foolish. The swaying motion from being carried begins to lull her to sleep. She has to fight it or she will die. She rhythmically works her muscles, tensing and releasing them. She thinks of Perrin and what he should do to Masema. She imagines the argument they will have when he learns she has been using Cha Faile as spies. The cold seeps into her and she begins losing concentration. Rolan keeps her awake by growling and slapping her bottom. Eventually, Faile slides off into dreams. She dreams of Perrin and of running across a vast icy wilderness.\nFaile dreams of a bonfire, and she moves closer to it to be warm. She feels hungry and a tall, bony man in a white woollen cowl moves close to her and gives her hot tea with honey. She gulps the tea and he tells her she must not spill any and that the Aiel offended her honor. Faile realizes this is not a dream. She is not bound any more and the man is a gai'shain. She clutches a blanket around her. The others are there with her in front of the fire, wrapped in blankets and clutching tea. Rolan and the other algai'd'siswai are in the tent as well, watching them. Faile suddenly realizes they must be in the Shaido camp if there are gai'shain here. She realizes this will make escape harder.\nFaile asks the gai'shain how her honor was offended. He tells her that gai'shain are not clothed at all until they are given proper robes. But because it was feared they would freeze to death, their captors had wrapped them in their coats and thus named them as weak. He says some of their captors were Mera'din and that Efalin should not have allowed them to do it. Faile wonders what a Mera'din is and thinks she must ask Bain and Chiad. Faile mutters she will see Rolan repaid as he deserves. She asks the man why they are taken gai'shain at all, isn\u2019t that against custom? What if they decide to break other customs and not let the man leave off being a gai'shain at the end of his time? The man says calmly that the Shaido break many customs but he does not. He will serve until his time is up. He asks if she has had enough tea since she is talking so much? Faile snatches the mug and tries to concentrate on finding something in the situation that could be turned to her advantage.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

              "pov_summary": "Three women enter the tent; two are obviously Wise Ones, Therava and Someryn. One is a gai'shain but her robes are made of silk and she is wearing a belt and collar made of gold and firedrops. The women stop in front of Faile and, with a curt gesture, dismiss their captors. Rolan hesitates for a moment and then leaves. Someryn says there are more gai\u2019shain for Sevanna and she tells Therava that Sevanna will not be satisfied until the whole world is gai\u2019shain. Therava says Sevanna has too many gai\u2019shain already. Faile thinks to herself that Therava is a dangerous woman and that she must act meek.\nAlliandre rises to her feet and announces herself and her rank. She says that she and her liege lady should be treated well as the Aiel can demand a large ransom for their return. Sevanna rides up and asks Galina, the gai\u2019shain in silk, if it is true that Alliandre is a wetlander queen. She also asks what a liege lady is. Galina explains that the liege lady would have to be a very powerful woman to have a queen swear fealty. She says this woman looks like Alliandre but she has no idea why she\u2019s here and not in Ghealdan. Therava silences Galina before she can ramble on. Faile notices that both Someryn and Therava dislike Sevanna; she thinks to herself that she has a personal claim on Sevanna for almost killing Perrin at Dumai's Wells.\nSevanna asks which of the women is the liege lady and which the liege lady\u2019s maid. Faile and Maighdin identify themselves. Sevanna studies them and finally orders Galina to heal them all so that they can walk\u2014she doesn\u2019t see why they should get to ride on the carts. Therava shoves Galina towards them telling her to do it quickly. Sevanna announces that tonight she and the Wise Ones will camp with the Jonine. Therava says that means a fifth sept has arrived while seventy eight remain scattered. She advises Sevanna to remember her pledge to reunite the Shaido because they will not wait forever. Sevanna tells Therava to remember that she is her advisor; Sevanna is the one who speaks for the clan chief! The Aiel women leave.\nGalina heals Faile and wastes no time doing the same to the others. Faile thinks furiously; why would an Aes Sedai be in the Aiel camp and in gai\u2019shain robes and ready to lick Sevanna\u2019s boots? Gai\u2019shain bring in dried meat, cheese and bread for the captives to eat. The food isn\u2019t very good but Faile eats it quickly and thinks it tastes like a feast for she is hungry. She is given a gai\u2019shain robe and boots. When an Amadician woman comes forward to put a golden belt on her Faile tells her she doesn't want it. The Amadician replies it does not matter; she serves Sevanna now and she must do as she is told. Maighdin and Alliandre are trying to fend off the collars and belts as well; Faile sighs and accepts the adornments meekly, prompting Maighdin and Alliandre to do the same.\nThe captives are soon tramping through the snow with the rest of the Aiel. Faile loses sight of Bain and Chiad. Maighdin announces firmly that they will have to find the Maidens tonight and that they are tiring themselves out trying to keep up with the Aiel\u2019s pace. Faile and Alliandre are surprised by the maid\u2019s decisiveness but Faile cannot fault her spirit. Faile agrees that tonight is the night to escape. She tells the two that if they see a chance to escape while they are traveling to take it. Both women say they will stay with her until she escapes or they will not leave at all.\nTherava walks up to them and says she knows they are thinking of escaping. Faile attempts to appear meek but Therava is not fooled. Therava says that they will serve as gai\u2019shain for the rest of their lives unless they help her. Faile asks how they can do that. Therava wants them to spy on Sevanna and report back to her. Faile does not want to do it but she thinks if she does not agree then Therava will kill them all. She asks Therava if she will protect them if Sevanna finds out what they\u2019re doing. Therava says she will not; she will cook them herself if Sevanna finds out! Therava leaves. Maighdin tells them that Therava likely gives that speech to every gai\u2019shain who serves Sevanna; if they miss any detail, Therava will know and not be pleased. Maighdin reminds them all that they must think of themselves as servants every moment or they will perish. Faile agrees; until they escape they are all servants.\nDuring the travel to the new camp, Faile wonders why an Aes Sedai is with the Aiel. Galina comes to see them again. She asks Faile if she knows what she is, and Faile says she is an Aes Sedai but it\u2019s odd to see her in a servant\u2019s position here. Galina responds coolly that her work is very important. Faile demands to know whether Galina will help them escape or what she wants with them. Galina asks Alliandre if Faile is really her liege lady and who she is to have a queen swear to her. Faile says Galina can ask her and announces she is the Lady Faile t\u2019Aybara and that is all Galina needs to know. Galina makes the connection to Perrin and Rand but she promises Faile she won\u2019t tell if Faile obeys her. Faile is angry with herself for giving away her connections but asks Galina what she wants. Galina tells them to fetch a smooth white rod from Therava\u2019s tent and bring it to her. Faile tells her it may take time and Galina says she has her whole life if necessary. As Galina leaves, Faile thinks to herself that she will find a way out of this trap!\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

He is in the dream too strongly and for too long; if he doesn\u2019t go back he will die. When Perrin doesn\u2019t respond, Hopper attacks him in the dream and tells him to listen! Perrin\u2019s eyes snap open and he is in Berelain\u2019s tent; Berelain is there too. He asks Berelain if Faile has been found yet; she tells him that the scouts have not yet returned. She said she sent a full company out to look but they were ambushed 5-6 miles from camp.\nPerrin notices he is naked beneath the blankets and demands an explanation from Berelain. She says he and his armsmen might have frozen to death if she hadn\u2019t gone looking for them. Perrin was so numb he couldn\u2019t hear anyone speaking. She had him brought back to camp and the blankets piled on. Annoura healed him. Perrin notices that this is both too much of an explanation and not enough. He asks why one of the Asha'man didn\u2019t do the Healing and Berelain simply says she thought of Annoura first. Perrin gets up and asks for his clothes and food and Berelain leaves the tent. He feels very weak once stands up, his hands fumbling with even the simple task of putting his clothes on.\nBerelain returns in a swirl of cold air with his food and tells him Rosene is bringing more. She tells him she knows he is hurting and offers to call a truce until Faile is found. Perrin asks why they need a truce. Berelain is affronted and simply says if that\u2019s how he wants it then fine! She tells him that Masema\u2019s men began arriving that morning before daylight\u2014three or four thousand of them with more streaming in every minute. Perrin is angry because he was only supposed to bring himself and a hundred men and he says they\u2019ll see about that! Berelain says Masema is the real danger\u2014does Perrin know he\u2019s been meeting with the Seanchan? Perrin asks how Berelain knows that and she tells him that Faile\u2019s \u201cretainers\u201d told her.

She stretches sensuously and tells Perrin he will be only the third man to share her bed; the other two were for politics but Perrin will be for pleasure. Rosene comes into the tent then with food but Perrin leaves the tent. He walks through the camp and approaches some servants who make no efforts to hide their curiosity of him leaving Berelain\u2019s tent. He asks them where the Prophet\u2019s men are.

He also feels cut off from his own people, those from the Two Rivers, because they do not treat him as they once used to but as their liege lord and protector. He is embarrassed by them calling him alternately \"Lord Perrin\" and \"Lord Goldeneyes\", but because Faile has told him he must get used to it he no longer protests where people can hear. In addition he is well aware that the disappearance of Queen Alliandre of Ghealdan with Faile could very well incite the imminent conflict between the Aiel following Perrin and the soldiers from Ghealdan - and Lini, at least, has noticed that something is going on between him and Berelain and is not at all impressed. It is Master Gill who most unwillingly informs Perrin of this; Lini herself merely sniffs and uses imagery that Perrin does not understand.\nHe is sought out by Selande and the other members of Cha Faile, who initially demand that he give their horses back, which he agrees to if they agree to obey him as they would Faile until the latter has returned. Perrin is somewhat puzzled by the hierarchy within this group, but does not care - it is quite obvious that he sees them as an annoyance more than anything else. As the entire group is about to exit the camp, the small group of scouting Aiel and the Warders return with proof that Faile and the other women have not been harmed and that the Aiel who attacked and captured them are a mix of different Aiel societies but that the group were dominated by Shaido. The Aiel with him, among them Sulin, manage to convince Perrin that for now Faile and the others are most likely quite safe; she refuses to believe that even Shaido would break Aiel custom far enough to actually kill someone made gai'shain. She and the Warders who returned with the Aiel also warn Perrin that the Aiel army is most likely quite big, that there is also a far bigger non-Aiel army in the area and that they have seen creatures associated with the Seanchan invaders. His response is two-fold; he sends Asha'man Neald to tell Elyas and the other Asha'man what his plans are and moves his own army, consisting of Aiel, Two Rivers folk, Asha'man, Ghealdanin and Mayeners, forty miles due south by the means of Traveling. He also intends to send someone to find Masema, but before he gets that far Masema comes to him.\nMasema, despite Perrin's initial orders that he come alone, brings one hundred men. Perrin informs him of Faile's kidnapping and orders Masema to take his group east; telling him he and his army will join them once they have recovered Faile. Masema claims he and his soldiers wish to come with him; Perrin tries to discourage this by pointing out that he intends to Travel but Masema states that for the purpose of bringing back the wife of a friend of the Dragon Reborn, channeling will be permitted.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

              "pov_summary": "Elayne and her entourage, including the Brown sister Sareitha and the Guardswomen Caseille Raskovni and Deni Colford, are riding through the streets of Caemlyn in an attempt to raise support - or at least halt displeasure - among its citizens and visitors. Elayne gives out coins to several people, and is worried about not only the finances of her people but also of that of her nation. While all people she passes halt, the cheers are few and far in between. There are, however, no jeers, a fact that calms Elayne to some extent. Her entourage, consisting of the Brown sister, her Warder and altogether eight Guardswomen clad in the rather elaborate dress of Elayne's honour guard, attract their own attention, and as they pass through the streets of Caemlyn Sareitha gives Elayne a lecture on how the streets are not safe for her and how the ten sisters currently in the Silver Swan do not bode well. Elayne brushes the Brown's various fears away, but inside she is not as calm as she appears.\nAs she rides through the city she also ponders the fact that some of the fugitives from the war-ridden or occupied neighbouring countries seem to have returned to themselves in the sense that they have taken up their own crafts again. Not only does it help these individuals to provide for themselves, it also reduces the need to import wares from other countries and has the additional advantage of the taxes being a possible income in the future. Some, or even most of the fugitives, though, are not only unable to fend for themselves, some of them are even unable or unwilling to accept the help they are being given. While soup kitchens have been set up for the poor, no one can make people accept them.\nThose she notices most, though, are the many mercenaries and merchant's guards wandering the streets. Whether Andoran or foreign, they are armed, and since there are so many of them that their \"normal\" professions are full, Elayne decides that getting some of them to sign up for the army should not be too much trouble. Mostly, she is concerned with two things; how to make sure the Guards remain mostly Andoran, and how to find enough coin to pay them. As she thinks about this she becomes aware of the strong emotions of her Warder Birgitte, and the combination of her strong emotions and the speed with which she returns to the palace sets \"the alarm gongs ringing\" in Elayne's head and she hurries back to the palace by the most direct route in order to meet her there.\nBirgitte finds them outside the inner city, climbing Pearman's Lane, and wastes little time before telling Elayne that the men escorting Naean and Elenia, two of the contestants for the Andoran crown, have been killed five miles out of Aringill. One of the guards' horses had returned to the town and thus let the soldiers stationed there know. Elayne promptly concludes that there must be at least one spy within the Palace, and Birgitte repeats her plea that Elayne accept a small group of bodyguards. The plea is refused despite of Sareitha's agreement that it might be a good idea, and Elayne angers her Warder further by suggesting that she should have gone to get the two captives herself. Birgitte harangues her not only about how her involvement in getting them would have made no difference except for possibly to the worse, and also hints to Elayne's and Aviendha's lone trip in town. The hint is enough to make the Brown sister elaborate; she seems to know more about it than Birgitte has been told and Birgitte does not seem to appreciate this in the least. Elayne gets her own back to some extent by giving Sareitha a mini-lecture on Andoran practical politics that leaves the Brown stunned and somewhat surprised by the younger woman's grasp on the reality of the nation she has set out to rule, and the rest of the ride back to the palace is passed in silence and with Elayne pondering some of the problems she currently has on her plate.\nTheir arrival at the palace is a surprise for everyone there, and Elayne notices that there are very few faces she can really say she recognizes among the current servants and soldiers, since many of the old ones fled when Rand took Caemlyn. After the news Birgitte brought she sees a potential spy in most people, and so, seemingly, does Birgitte. Sareitha and her Warder leave the two of them with the plausible excuse of Sareitha wanting something in the Library, and then Elayne and Birgitte have a small argument about a Warder's place and Birgitte's accusation that Elayne gave her the titles and the estate in an attempt to \"saddle her down\", after which Birgitte stalks out. Elayne notices a young boy (only a bit younger than herself, she realizes,) and tells him to go fetch Mistress Harfor, the First Maid, to her apartments.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

Halwin Norry, the Head Clerk, wishes to speak to her, and the animosity or, rather, jealousy between the two concerning their jobs is evident to Elayne. Others asking for an appointment including several merchants, and Mistress Harfor advises her on how to deal with them in a way that makes Elayne thinks about how her mother, the former Queen Morgase, used to say that she ruled Andor but thought the Head Maid ruled her. After the two Kinswomen Solain Morgeillin and Keraille Surtovni pass them, Mistress Harfor also mentions that \"Mistress Corly\" has requested a meeting, and instead of taking the files the Head Maid asked her to sign before they are sent to the Head Clerk into her apartment, Elayne asks that the files be left there and heads out to find the former Eldest of the Knitting Circle, which is, or rather used to be, the ruling body of the Kin.\nIn the hallways she runs into Vandene, followed closely and meekly by the two elderly novices Zarya and Kirstian. They have, in spite of their rather intensive training and strict discipline, been able to learn that the murderer of Vandene's sister Adeleas must be one of three sisters; Merilille, Sareitha or Careane. Since the only ones who have known the truth of the matter till now have been Nynaeve, Elayne or Vandene, the two will need to be \"taken in hand\"; given more work and more discipline, which in Vandene's opinion will mean either Nynaeve or Elayne. Nynaeve and Lan appear just in time to hear the brief discussion, however, and because Nynaeve is stronger enough in the One Power that Vandene is supposed to defer to her, Vandene ends up with that chore herself. Zarya and Kirstian, who appear to be quite smug at times in the conversation, are near fainting when they hear that Vandene did indeed teach novices for a time, but that the then Mistress of Novices, later Amyrlin Seat Sereille Bagand, thought she was too hard on her students.\nElayne asks if Nynaeve knows what Reanne Corly would like to talk to her about, and even if Nynaeve hasn't been out of her rooms she knows where the woman is likely to be and \"offers\" to take Elayne there after the two have been looking at each other for a bit; Nynaeve with first suspicion and then something that Elayne correctly or not thinks might be condescension. Elayne agrees without words, taking the \"guiding\" - she already knows where Reanne must be, since she is not with Nynaeve - as a penance for her behaviour earlier the same day. On their way Elayne also brings up the news about Elenia, Naean and the spies, and Nynaeve isn't shocked; if anything she appears surprised they were still held when they themselves reached Caemlyn. She also tells Elayne that eighteen of the Kin are no longer in Caemlyn; they have gone deep into Altara, Amadicia and Tarabon to attempt saving the members of the Kin who are still there from the clutches of the Seanchan. The other objective is to keep them from running away, and Nynaeve brings up another problem concerning the Kin, or rather, Egwene's promise to them; that all women with the ability to channel who desire it shall be connected to the Tower in some way.\nWhen they meet Reanne, she tells them that three of the captured damane might be ready to be freed of their collars after closing the ears of the captured sul'dam Marli with Air. The three damane in question are Alivia, Kara and Lemore. Lemore is only nineteen years old; Kara is highly protective and quite obedient to the sul'dam, and despite Alivia's supposed hatred towards the sul'dam they are not sure that she, either, can be trusted. She is, unlike the others, Seanchan, has been a damane for more than four hundred years - and she is more powerful by far than even Nynaeve. After Lan's comment that if they do not set them free after the women in question have told them they wish to be freed they would be no better than the Seanchan themselves, Nynaeve makes a decision which is clearly supported by Alise; that the women shall be set free. However, they will be kept under careful eyes, especially Lemore, who they will put in novice white as soon as it can be arranged because of her young age.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

              "pov_summary": "Elayne changes out of her riding clothes with the help of Essande, a pensioner she has chosen for her maid, to get ready for the meeting with the merchants. She reminds herself to make sure Birgitte is there, and allows herself to notice a \"heated knot of irritation\" before going out into her sitting room where the First Clerk, Norry, awaits her. His first piece of news, the find of first quality alum at Danabar, is good news, because its prospective income will mean that the bankers are far more likely to agree to loan the kingdom of Andor some much-needed funds to, among other things, build up the needed army to secure the throne for Elayne. There are, of course, expenses to be taken into account, but master Norry still agrees that both the Guard as well as the Academy can now be looked into without too much worry.\nThe next topic is the Dragon Reborn and Elaida's proclamation acknowledging him and offering him \"protection and guidance\" as well as pronouncing anathema on anyone approaching him save through the Tower. The proclamation stuns Elayne, and so does the news that someone attacked the Sun Palace using the One Power, and that Rand is gone. Norry's source suggests that Rand has probably gone to kneel at Elaida's feet, but Elayne refuses to believe he would even kneel to Egwene and that Elaida has as much chance as \"a goat at a court ball\".\nHis other pieces of news are either outdated or Elayne perceives them as unimportant; the latter includes news of Sea Folk ships making their way through the Fingers of the Dragon without pilots and fighting the Seanchan at sea; Illian being quiet and full of Rand's soldiers, assumed to be recovering from a battle against the Seanchan, the Queen of Saldaea still being on her long retreat in the country, the Queen of Kandor having been out of Chachin for months. Elayne asks for his advice, but merely, it seems, out of politeness since she already knows what to do about it - nothing. His last piece of news concerns the fact that King Roedran is gathering an army in Lugard, and when it comes to this aspect Halwin Norry surprises Elayne by seeming almost hesitant before giving his advice. Again it is to do nothing, but that is because Elayne has not yet been crowned Queen of Andor and thus cannot expect an emissary of hers to ever reach the King since that might mean repercussions for him if another contestant for the throne is able to get rid of Elayne. Elayne decides to calm Norry down, however, and tells him about Roedran's aims as she has been told by Egwene.\nThis impresses Norry, and he \"remembers\" something he left out in his first round; the fact that Cairhienin nobles are pondering coming to Andor to help her claim the throne there so that she can come to Cairhien quickly and claim her birthright from her father Taringail as well. Elayne thanks him and tells him to write out a letter ready for her signature and seal, in which she states that she will come to Cairhien once she has time and implies that the Cairhienin nobles should keep out of Andor since anything else would only worsen the strained relationship between the two nations. She says nothing straight out, of course, but feels assured that the smarter among the noble Houses will understand and explain it to those who are not as smart.\nAfter, three liveried maids bring her a large choice of midday meals, of which she chooses the one she always does; clear broth and bread served with tea. Dyelin enters during the meal, and announces that there is an army in Braem Wood; an army consisting of men from Arafel, Kandor and Shienar, tens of thousands altogether. Elayne says that it's more than likely Rand they are after, refills her cup and talks some more before she starts to slip away. She realizes that she has been dosed with forkroot, a drug that puts people to sleep and leaves channelers unable to touch the Source, and tells Dyelin to go get help. Dyelin pulls out a knife, and for a few seconds Elayne is grateful for the man entering, thinking that Dyelin has turned traitor - until she sees him pull out a blade of his own and two more following. Despite knowing there is nothing she can do to save herself, Elayne decides to try, and Dyelin screams for help and manages to send two men to the floor before she is stabbed and left to die by a third. He advances on Elayne, slowly at first but then with newfound determination, but suddenly, he and Elayne are equally surprised by the foot of steel sticking out from his chest, and he dies. Elayne falls to her knees and manages to think of how the carpets might never become clean again before looking at the motionless Dyelin and the three men gathered close to the open door. The second of the would-be assassins lie in front of it while the third and sole survivor is fighting an axe-faced man in the white-collared coat of a Guardsman. Her last thought is for Birgitte to come, and then darkness consumes her."

              "pov_summary": "She wakes up in her own bedchamber, surrounded by Aviendha, Birgitte and Nynaeve. She reaches out for saidar, and touches it but does not draw on it. She asks for Dyelin and the Guardsman, learning from Nynaeve that both are alright and from Birgitte that Nynaeve did not Heal her with the Power; instead she used her herbs. Nynaeve is prickly about her ability in that field since it became clear that several of the Kin are outstripping her, and while Aviendha seems to be content to have returned to being a Wise One Apprentice, she is still delighted to say that she has been allowed to stay with Elayne after the attack on her life. Birgitte finally gets Elayne's approval of a bodyguard, and after a brief discussion they decide that the former Lieutenant Doilin Mellar, who was the one saving her life in the past chapter, shall be raised to Captain and put in charge of her bodyguard as a reward.\nThe faint sound of a gong atop the palace's tallest tower reminds Elayne that she and Nynaeve had agreed to meet Egwene in Tel'aran'rhiod that same night, and after a brief discussion that includes Aviendha and Birgitte, Nynaeve agrees that Elayne will go with her, even if she originally intended her patient to stay in bed and heal further. Nynaeve goes to her own bedchamber after telling Birgitte and Aviendha to guard Elayne's body in her sleep. The two of them dislike her commanding tone and presence, but after muttering for a bit and watching Elayne drink the tea Nynaeve has laced with something to make her sleep they agree on a system for guarding their charge. Aviendha stays in the room with Elayne while Birgitte goes out into the sitting room.\nIn Tel'aran'rhiod, Elayne awakens in the Grand Hall, the throne room of the palace, and sees a young girl dreaming herself there as well. She, however, disappears as soon as she notices and recognizes Elayne, and other details about the interior shifts as well according to the rules of Tel'aran'rhiod. She imagines a stand-mirror to check her own appearance, and Nynaeve enters as Elayne tries to tell herself that she will do well as Queen of Andor. The elder woman tells her to allow her to do the talking once Egwene appears in order to avoid blundering, but becomes very flustered indeed when her \"apprentice\" from their last days in Emond's Field appears. Elayne tells Egwene about the attempted murder and adds the news about the day's events. Egwene does not seem too impressed; she already knows about Rand and gives a \"dismissive shake\" at the news that Vandene is no closer to finding the Black who killed her sister.\nEgwene says that she would tell them all to join her in Murandy if it had not been for the Kin, but since the Sitters would probably have \"issues\" with the Kinswomen she tells them to stay where they are for now, until Egwene has gained more control. Egwene tells them about the problems she has with the Sitters; that they obey her in word but hardly in spirit, that several of them are working towards stopping the acceptance of new novices, especially the elder ones, and that most sisters still treat Faolain and Theodrin as Accepted. She also tells Elayne and Nynaeve that they will be required to swear the Three Oaths on the Oath Rod as soon as it can be recovered, and that the full weight of Tower justice will be used against those who refuse taking the Oaths but continue to call themselves Aes Sedai.\nShe also tells them just how she intends to bind the Kin to the Tower; by allowing those sisters who choose to resign from being Aes Sedai to free themselves of the Oaths and join the Kin instead. Since the Kin is and still will be ruled by age, this means that former Aes Sedai will have to accept standing below elder women who could never reach Accepted, and for Nynaeve especially this seems to be somewhat hard to contemplate. At the end of their discussion, the three girls discover and pursue a man that looks like he could be Rand's mean uncle, dressed in a Shienaran coat, as well as hearing a door close and thus realizing that at least two people have listened in on their discussion. The Shienaran coat reminds Elayne of the Borderlanders in Braem Wood, and as she tells Egwene about them she also realizes that she might be able to use them to secure the Lion Throne."

It is, however, only another Black sister, the Brown Eldrith whom Moghedien left in charge when she left them to their own devices even if Chesmal seems to give only cursory notice to that fact. Eldrith and the others feel forced to flee from Eldrith's Warder Kennit; he knows she is a murderer, suspects she is Black and is determined to kill her despite the less than comfortable consequences to himself.\nThe next to enter is Temaile, and we quickly learn that she is the second person watching the meeting between Elayne, Nynaeve and Egwene as well as that the other three Black sisters are somewhat afraid of her after Moghedien made them watch her breaking down Liandrin. Temaile is supposed to defer to Eldrith as well, but instead she is very clearly the leader among the four Blacks. Her goal is to take Nynaeve and possibly Elayne in the bargain and use the two of them to gain the protection of one of the Chosen."

When the Lady Shiaine tells her bluntly that since the Brown is under orders from Moghedien to obey her and that she suspects Moghedien obeys Moridin absolutely, she should not talk about what she will not do, the Brown informs her that there is a Black sister in the palace.

The other Sea Folk give the girl some instructions and demand that Nynaeve take her through the exercise again. This time Talaan shields Nynaeve. Nynaeve wants to end the lesson but the Windfinders, Zaida in particular, have other plans.\nThey have Talaan shield her as tightly as possible and demand Nynaeve try and break free. Nynaeve already told them repeatedly you can't break through a shield unless you are a lot stronger in the power than the person shielding you. The Windfinders never seem to believe her on anything unless it is shown to them though. As an encouragement Talaan has to lift Nynaeve upside down. Nynaeve of course protests but it is of no use. They don't let Nynaeve go until she has pitted every ounce of strength against Talaan's shield and fails to break it.\nOutside Nynaeve meets Alivia, a captured Seanchan damane with extraordinary strength in the One Power.

He gives her the statue that is the key to the most powerful female sa'angreal ever made and tells her he intends to use it to cleanse the male half of the source. Lan again challenges him. Why didn't they do that in the Age of Legends if it could be done? Rand says he doesn't know that but feels it has to be tried. Nynaeve agrees given the alternative, but she has her own ideas on how to go about it neither of the men will like.

Getting dressed she decides she is going to need her veil. Selucia obviously disapproves. Last night she gave a command in anger though, and lost honour because of it. Stepping out of her cabin Tuon meets her damane. She punished one of them last night after she asked the damane to tell the future for her. To make it up she now commands her welts to be taken care of and that the damane is to have sweet custard with every meal until her welts are gone. Tuon prides herself for being able to train damane with the best of the sul'dam.\nOn deck the members of the blood meet her as well as members of the Deathwatch Guard, dedicated to her personal protection. The Macura woman is on deck too. She sold them some valuable information but her hatred against Aes Sedai goes deep and she is looking for opportunities to do them more damage.\nOn the Quarterdeck her truthspeaker Anath is waiting for her. She immediately notices the veil and begins to tell her just how silly she is acting. The truthspeaker's job is to tell you just that, plain and simple, whether you want to hear it or not. Tuon is still not comfortable with Anath though. Her previous truthspeaker died less then two years ago. Anath's appointment was a bit of a surprise but nobody questions the Empress, may she live forever. After Anath is done telling her just how silly the veil is Tuon informs her she will not need penance.\nThey now turn their attention to what to do when they arrive in Ebou Dar. Tuon says Suroth is to be commended for her work with the Forerunners. And her ambition must be looked into. Anath seems convinced Suroth is acting in the best interest of the Empire but Tuon privately thinks great success can breed even greater ambition. Tuon must also make contact with the Dragon Reborn. He must kneel before the Crystal Throne or all will be lost according to the prophecy.\nIn the distance she sees Ebou Dar. The Corenne would spread from Ebou Dar as it had from Tanchico.

Aludra isn't cooperating though. Even the idea that the Seanchan damane can make her fireworks look like sparks up the chimney doesn't seem to bother Aludra. She will not tell him Guild's secrets. Mat points out that she is no longer a member of the Guild and that nobody has come to stop her making nightflowers yet. She is not likely to see another Illuminator again.\nNow visibly upset Aludra demands to know what he has heard. Mat tells her the rumor is that that the chapter house in Tanchico is gone as well. Exploded in the fighting that followed a refusal to let the Seanchan in. Fearing the One Power was used the Seanchan proceeded to make the survivors da'covale. Aludra wants to know what he would do with fireworks anyway. Throw them from a catapult perhaps? Mat has other military purposes in mind. She should see it as a way to repay the Seanchan.\nAludra now has had enough of the discussion. She has thought long on the military potential of fireworks. She will set him a riddle and if he can solve it she will tell him all her secrets, even the ones that will make him blush. The riddle is to tell her why she may have use for a bellfounder. Mat doesn't see the answer straight away but Aludra doesn't want one now anyway. She tells him to come back in two or three days and leave her alone to work now.

He could have Vanin steal them of course but he is not quite that desperate yet. Mat reflects that Perrin and Rand are probably in front of some warm fireplace swilling wine at this moment. A faint rush of colors swirls through his head when he thinks of Perrin and Rand lately. Mat doesn't know why and doesn't particularly want to know.\nHe finds Thom and Beslan with Luca and Olver in the company of a number of women. Not an uncommon sight these days. Some of Olver's uncles are a decidedly bad influence on the boy. After he collects Olver, one of the women has the nerve to pinch his bottom when he leaves, Mat joins Thom and Beslan. Luca excuses himself to prepare a private show for the High Lady Suroth herself. Thom tells Mat Luca has agreed to take them when he leaves, at a very high price, but that he will probably not leave till spring. Mat swallows a curse. At least it'll give him time to get the necessary gold though. Beslan casually observes his mother will not like it if he helps Mat get away. Olver wants to get back the city. He has a reading lesson with Lady Riselle, who lets him use her formidable bosom for a pillow. Mat groans, his leg hurts, Tylin is waiting in the city and the dice just started tumbling in his head.

Emond's Field is no longer a small village, but a considerable and prosperous town. For an instant, Elayne sees the Red Eagle of Manetheren atop one of the flagpoles, and thinks to herself that she must do something about it. Elayne suggests that Egwene take a few hours to visit Emond's Field in the waking world, but Egwene replies that she is not ready to confront Emond's Field as Amyrlin. Egwene mentions that she is troubled by Rand chaining Aes Sedai to him.\nWhen Elayne leaves Tel'aran'rhiod, it is already morning in the waking world. She awakens Aviendha and is dressed by her maid, Essande, before they eat breakfast. Elayne thinks about her pregnancy.\nCaptain Mellar tells Elayne that Halwin Norry is waiting for her. Elayne acts very friendly to Mellar, whispering to Aviendha that the more people who believe that her child is his, the better.\nHalwin Norry enters Elayne's apartments. He tells her that the city's two most prominent bankers are amenable to loaning her money because of the alum that was found in one of her estates. He goes on to talk about the sewers, the price of grain, the Borderlander army in New Braem, and rumors of Aes Sedai swearing fealty to Rand in Cairhien. When Halwin Norry leaves, Reene Harfor arrives. She tells Elayne that more spies have been found in the palace. After Reene come two delegations of merchants.\nAfterwards, Aviendha makes Elayne go for a walk outside. They see Reanne opening a gateway to check if Merilille is ready to return from her meeting with the Borderlands rulers, and Merilille rides through the gateway. Elayne and Aviendha hurry down to Elayne's sitting room, where they find Merilille, Birgitte and Captain Mellar waiting for them.\nMerilille tells Elayne that she has spoken to all of the rulers, and observed the camps. There are over two hundred thousand soldiers and, while they are not starving, they don't have a lot of food. There are also ten Aes Sedai with the army, although they try to stay hidden.

Aviendha and Birgitte try to talk Elayne out of going, but she persists. Birgitte wants to take a full bodyguard with them, but Elayne says that it will only be her, Birgitte and Aviendha. She does not want to be seen as the Daughter Heir of Andor, but as an Aes Sedai with her Warder. Surprisingly, Captain Mellar makes no objection to staying behind.\nElayne quickly eats her midday meal, and arranges to have Careane teach the Windfinders that night. She also asks Vandene a few questions about the Borderlands. She dresses, and they go down to the Traveling yard, where Reanne makes a gateway for them, since she knows roughly where the camp is. Elayne, Aviendha and Birgitte follow Merilille's tracks, with Birgitte and Aviendha worrying over Elayne's pregnant condition.\nWhen they reach the Shienaran camp, there are soldiers waiting for them, among them Kayen Yokata, one of King Easar's advisors and the Lord of Fal Eisen. He swears to Elayne that no harm will come to her. Elayne, Birgitte and Aviendha are led to a tent where Merilille is waiting with Easar, Ethenielle, Paitar and Tenobia, and everyone is introduced.\nElayne tells the rulers that she knows they are there because of Rand, and she wants to know exactly what they want. Ethenielle tells her that they have marched all this way only to find that no one knows where the Dragon Reborn is to be found. They want to know if Elayne knows where he is. Easar says that the war against the Shadow is fought along the Blight, and yet Rand does not concern himself with the Borderlands.\nElayne tells them that she does not know exactly where Rand is, but that apparently he intends to remain where he is for some time. She says that she can give them a general idea, but only if they march south within a week. They puzzle out that Elayne wants them to move south into Andor because the Andorans will see them as an invading army and will hopefully band together behind Elayne. When the Borderlanders reach Caemlyn, Elayne will \"negotiate\" them into leaving Andor without any fighting. They all agree, Tenobia adding the condition that she gets to see her uncle, Davram Bashere, who is with Rand. Elayne tells them that a search in Murandy will be profitable. Rand is actually in Tear, but Elayne's words are true; a search in Murandy will be profitable for her. Elayne hopes that it will force Arathelle, Luan and Pelivar to support her. None of the rulers seem overly exultant at receiving information on Rand.\nWith only a few hours of daylight remaining, Elayne, Birgitte, Aviendha and Merilille make their goodbyes and ride back to where they arrived through the gateway. Elayne weaves a gateway, and they all ride through it and make their way towards the palace. Elayne is exhausted and nearly falls asleep on the saddle. Birgitte begins to carry her into the palace, but Halwin Norry arrives with news for Elayne. There are four small armies approaching from the east, with twenty or thirty thousand men. He does not yet know who is leading them. Although Elayne is still exhausted, she leaps into defence mode, giving out orders. Master Norry is to begin buying as much food as possible at first light; Birgitte is to announce that the mercenaries have four days to either leave the city or sign up with the Guards; Master Norry is to announce to the people that they may leave the city before the siege begins; Merilille is to let the Kinswomen and Atha'an Miere know, so that they can leave if they want to as well; and Birgitte is to bring maps to her apartments.

They will be gone for a little over a week, and Mat knows that if he wants to escape, he will have to do it then. Two hours later, he is accompanying Tylin down to the docks. Tylin gives Mat a last kiss, and Mat stays and waves after her until she can no longer see him before riding back to the palace.\nAt the palace, Mat is stopped by Noal. The old man tells Mat that he knows Mat is up to something, and Noal would like to offer his services. Mat tries to deny that anything is going to happen, and Noal replies that he understands that Mat doesn't trust him yet. Noal then tells Mat that the gholam has killed another man, and reminds Mat that he is willing to help him before walking away. As Noal leaves, Mat notices Tuon watching him and shivers.\nMat sends Lopin to fetch some more clothes, and Nerim to find Juilin. When Juilin arrives, Mat notices that he is extremely happy. Juilin says that he is just happy that Suroth is gone, and Mat realizes that the woman Juilin is interested in must be one of Suroth's da'covale. Mat tells Juilin that he needs a damane dress to fit Joline, three sul'dam dresses and an a'dam. Juilin grumbles a bit, but agrees to do it.\nThe palace servants are starting to guess that Mat is planning to leave, since he is no longer wearing the clothes that Tylin gave him. Mat tries to encourage the belief, because he doesn't want anyone to blame Tylin for the disappearance of two damane.\nSome nights, Mat meets with Thom and Juilin to discuss their escape. One night, Beslan listens in and declares that he wants to help. He suggests using an uprising as a distraction, one that Beslan and his friends would be happy to provide. Mat tries to talk him out of it.\nJuilin learns that the damane are not guarded at night, so they will have to escape during the night. Thom learns that one of the Blood can take damane out of the city with no questions asked, though sul'dam need an order signed and sealed by one of the Blood, a higher officer or captain, or a der'sul'dam. Thom is prepared to forge a seal and signature to get them out of the city.\nAll during this, the gholam has killed every night. The Seekers have been commanded to find the killer no matter what, so there are more guards in the street. Mat knows that this will make it harder to escape undetected.\nFinally, Juilin brings him good news. He has acquired two dresses and an a'dam.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

Min tries to reassure Rand, but he feels distant, though he tells her that he found what he needed in Far Madding. He fills himself with saidin, and can feel the other Asha'man do the same. They ride back to where he had buried Callandor. He lies to Min about feeling well. He then announces to the group that he plans on removing the taint from the male half of the Source. He explains that he will use the Choedan Kal, which are connected to the immense sa'angreal, one on Tremalking, the other in Cairhien for that purpose. Cadsuane asks who will be using the key for the woman, and Rand tells her that Nynaeve will link with him. Both Kumira and Nesune challenge Rand\u2019s decision. Cadsuane doesn\u2019t say anything beyond where he wants to do the deed, to which he answers Shadar Logoth.\nHe weaves a gateway to a place a few miles north of Shadar Logoth. Once they are all through, Cadsuane starts issuing orders, and Rand doesn\u2019t stop her. Eben remarks how nice it will be to channel without the taint. Cadsuane gathers all those who can channel around her, while Nynaeve goes to speak with Rand. Alivia comes up to Nynaeve and asks for all the ter'angreal Nynaeve has been carrying around with her. Nynaeve isn't happy about this, but does as she\u2019s asked. Rand then prepares himself, sitting on the ground, cross-legged in front of Nynaeve, who is sitting on a stone the size of a small bench. She gives him the male key, and places the female key beside her feet. She then instructs him to put himself right on the edge of embracing the Source, so she can link with him. Rand releases saidin, but when he does, he sees a faint face float in front of his eyes. Nynaeve bends toward him, but he shrugs it off, and reaches through the male key to the Source, but doesn't seize it. Then Nynaeve reaches through her key, and links with him. She cannot stand the feel of the taint, and she jumps when he takes control of the link. He marvels at the difference of saidar. He stops fighting the current of saidar, and begins weaving a conduit that connects saidin to Shadar Logoth. He forces saidin into the weave of saidar; saidar squeezes into itself, while saidar pushes at, all the while, flowing from the Source into Shadar Logoth. He feels a slight stirring, but doesn't know if it\u2019s working yet. He draws in more, struggling with saidin."

Their talking is interrupted when they cross paths with three Brown sisters, Marris Thornhill, Doraise Mesianos and Elin Warrel. With the marked hostility between Ajahs, Meidani pretends to be asking Yukiri a question about Arafellin law on fishing rights. After some glaring, the Browns stalk past Yukiri and Meidani and they resume talking about the Black Ajah. Their talks are continually interrupted as they walk past servants and other Aes Sedai who are also out walking. Yukiri has a hard time maintaining her composure when they pass Pritalle Nerbaijan and Atuan Larisett; Atuan is Black Ajah.\nYukiri remembers that Meidani and Elaida were good friends as novices and tells Meidani that she should renew her friendship with Elaida. Meidani tells Yukiri that she has already tried but Alviarin won't let her see Elaida. Yukiri tells Meidani that she's in luck as Alviarin has just left the Tower; she orders Meidani to visit Elaida.\nThe pair is once again interrupted, this time by the arrival of Seaine. Yukiri is not happy that Seaine is out of her apartments; Seaine had been ordered to stay in them as she might be targeted to be killed by the Black Ajah. Seaine says she is safe and asks to speak with Yukiri alone.\nOnce Yukiri and Seaine are in private, Seaine tells her that she has worked out a strange pattern of how the Ajahs replaced their Sitters who joined the rebels. All of the Heads of Ajahs had an abnormally large hand in picking the new Sitters - to the point where they went against customs and rules of their individual Ajahs. Seaine suggests that the Heads of Ajahs conspired on who to choose but does not know what their purpose in doing so was; she does, however, intend to figure it out as she has lots of time to think."

Sashalle asks Samitsu if Ailil Riatin can claim the High Seat of House Riatin since Toram has disappeared.

Corgaide Marendevin, the Holder of the Keys of the Sun Palace, interrupts them to report that an Ogier and a young man have entered the kitchens supposedly looking for Ogier stonemasons. Sashalle announces that they should go investigate; this irritates Samitsu because she is supposed to be in charge but ends up following Sashalle's lead.\nWhen they arrive in the kitchen, the Ogier and the young man are surrounded by kitchen staff including Eldrid Methin, Mistress Beldair, Andil and Kasi. The Ogier is telling stories of his travels. When the kitchen staff sees Samitsu and Sashalle, they scurry back to work. The Ogier and the man, Karldin, attempt to leave but the Aes Sedai stop them. Samitsu says that she has heard of an Ogier, a friend of Rand's, who had left in the company of a young man named Karldin. She correctly guesses that the Ogier is Loial.\nKarldin demands that the Aes Sedai tell him what happened to Rand, whether he is sane, and about his friends. Samitsu tells Karldin that Rand is sane but that he has left the Sun Palace as there had been an attempt to kill him. Loial is insisting that he and Karldin must find Rand when a serving woman, Cera Doinal, bursts into the kitchen with the news that Dobraine has been murdered.\nSashalle, Samitsu, Loial and Karldin immediately go to Dobraine's apartments to see what happened. When they arrive, they find Dobraine lying motionless in his room, apparently dead, along with two dead servants. Sashalle orders Samitsu to see if anything can still be done for Dobraine. Irritated at yet another command, Samitsu nonetheless moves to Dobraine's side. When she Delves him, she finds he is still alive although severely injured. She Heals him to the best of her ability and orders his servants to give him honey-water and find a Reader to give him herbs. Meanwhile, Karldin finds a note that has been forged to look like it was written by Dobraine; it appears to give the bearers authority to remove items from his apartment. They conclude that the men who attacked Dobraine must have been there to steal something.

She is dressing and preparing to leave Lord Aedmun's manor when the maid, Elsie shrieks. She claims to have seen a ghost. Elayne laughs at herself for fearing the Black Ajah has found her. She joins Aviendha downstairs and becomes irritated with Aviendha's mothering her because she is pregnant. She wonders where Rand is, though through the bond, she knows he is somewhere to the West. Aviendha reassures her that he is well, and if not, he will answer to her. They both laugh before sobering with fear for the man they both love.\nFridwyn Ros, the estate manager enters to tell Elayne that her bags are being stowed on the horses and the men being sent with her are mounted as they can. Elayne reassures Fridwyn that she is grateful for what they send, and the loyalty of the House. She and Aviendha join the Queen's Guard and the men from the estate. Caseille Raskovni, a lieutenant in the Guard, assures her that they are all ready to be on their way. As they ride, Aviendha questions whether these visits to the manors are worth it. They have only gathered young boys and old men. Elayne tells her it is very worth it. It lets the people see her and know that she is alive, well and can speak in her favor. She would visit every village in Andor if she had time. Aviendha says that she will learn a great deal about how to be a Wise One from her, which makes Elayne blush.\nThey reach the place where they arrived by gateway and Aviendha opens a new one. Elayne wonders if it is for practice or to keep her from channeling. She does not know if channeling will harm the child she carries. They are all startled by the blazing beacon of saidar suddenly being used to the west. She knows that Rand is in danger and wishes to go to him. Aviendha says they must not. They have no way of knowing what is actually happening and could be hurt by barging in. They argue a bit over it. Aviendha reminds Elayne of Rhuidean and the visions she saw in the ter'angreal. She cannot remember anything but bits and pieces, but she knows if they go to him now it will mean disaster. Elayne tells Aviendha that she has nothing to learn from Elayne about being a Wise One. She is already much wiser and braver than Elayne herself. They return to Caemlyn through the gateway.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

Birgitte and the Guardswomen greet them; Birgitte immediately joins Aviendha so they might discuss Elayne's health and habits.\nIrritated over their mothering, the amount of Guardswomen surrounding her at all times, and a headache via the bond due to excessive drinking on Birgitte's part, Elayne attempts to put them in place, but only succeeds in making Aviendha blush.\nWhile wondering why Birgitte has not been Healed, Elayne is told that Dyelin has not returned and thinks over how, out of over four hundred Houses, only ten of the major nineteen have to stand to elect a queen. Arymilla already has six Houses behind her to Elayne's two. Dyelin is sure three others will come, but Elayne is unsure because those three Houses seem determined to put Dyelin on the throne.\nBirgitte grumbles over the new recruits brought in from the minor Houses, but goes on to tell of how she had asked Sumeko for Healing only to have Sumeko pass out. She mentions that the Kin and the Windfinders were all behaving oddly.\nElayne explains briefly about the beacon of saidar and its connection, somehow, to Rand and receives sympathy from Aviendha and Birgitte in return. All agree there is nothing that can be done for it when they run into Vandene, Merilille, Sareitha, and Careane.\nElayne notes that Vandene appears to be wearing one of Adeleas' dresses as Vandene walks off, avoiding Sareitha's attempts to stop her. After accepting the remaining Aes Sedai's curtsies, Elayne remarks that she does not know what the beacon of saidar is, and, despite many arguments, puts down the idea of running away from it.\nAfter this, the other sisters turn to complaining about Vandene not teaching the Sea Folk, but Elayne stamps this down as well.\nShortly after, Captain Mellar arrives with Birgitte telling all that Mellar led a sortie at the gate without orders, leaving the Gate open the whole time. Sareitha protests and insists Mellar was a hero in his actions. When asked about his actions by Elayne, Mellar proudly admits allowing eighty men into Caemlyn, and Elayne notes aloud that because their liege lord is not committed to her, the men will have to be watched at all times and places him with the task.\nSareitha continues to defend him and goes so far as to accuse Elayne of forgetting her debt from his act of saving her life. Elayne dismisses them while thinking Adeleas' killer lies among the three and making a vow to repay her debts.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

Much to the displeasure of the Chief Maid, Birgitte sits nearby and discusses the merchant's trains from Tear bringing grain and rumor that High Lord Darlin, the Steward of Tear, was under attack by nobles hoping to oust the Dragon Reborn.\nWhile bathing, Elayne thinks about her eagerness to hear of both her brother, Gawyn, and her half-brother, Galad. In the midst of this, Birgitte announces that two sisters, Green and Gray, came to Caemlyn to an inn called the Silver Swan, while two others, Yellow and Brown, left. Elayne thinks on hearing rumor that Cadsuane Sedai has come out of retirement.\nIn the middle of her thoughts on the inner webs of the White Tower, the sounds of an argument flows in from the antechamber. Slipping into her robe, Elayne follows a snarling Birgitte and naked Aviendha to find Zaida, Chanelle, and Shielyn of the Sea Folk waiting for her.\nElayne's attempts to dismiss the Atha'an Miere are ignored as Zaida announces that Nesta din Reas Two Moons, the Mistress of the Ships, has died and that she must Travel to meet the First Twelve in order to choose a new leader. She demands three sisters go with her as a start to the payment of previous bargains.\nElayne notes dismally that without the Windfinders' strength, Caemlyn will soon begin to go hungry, as most of the Kin are not strong enough to hold a gateway.\nOver tea, Elayne points out that the Atha'an Miere were promised twenty teachers chosen by the Amyrlin Seat, but that if Windfinders no longer helped Caemlyn, the bargain would be void. Zaida returns the point by demanding Merilille Sedai go, to which Elayne agrees but mentally adds a clause in case she discovers Merilille to be Black Ajah.\nThe two continue to banter over Windfinders staying until an agreement is reached giving Elayne nine Windfinders who would obey her word until her crown was secured and only agreeing to make gateways, while giving the Sea Folk Merilille Sedai for a year as well as one square mile of good Andoran ground by the river for trade.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

While watching a parade of dresses, Elayne muses on how little her dress choice means now, due to the fact that no merchants come to the palace for fear of angering Arymilla if Elayne loses the Succession.\nMidway through the grooming, Birgitte walks in to announce that Dyelin had returned with four High Seats to meet with Elayne. Quickly, Elayne changes into a formal gown and jewellery and teases Aviendha into doing the same.\nUpon entering the formal sitting room, Elayne is introduced to the High Seats that have chosen to follow her, only to feel her spirits drop when realizing the four before her are little more than children with no advisers present.\nElayne fields questions and barely concealed insults from the group while being vague about subjects like the Kin and introducing them to her sister, Aviendha.\nAfter the four leave, Birgitte and Aviendha both barrage Dyelin with questions and comments on children leading, to which Dyelin speaks of taking her place as High Seat at fifteen due to her father's and her brothers' deaths. She then berates Birgitte for her language and suggestive dressing habits.\nElayne calmly explains the respect due to a High Seat, regardless of age or of experience, and reluctantly, Birgitte and Aviendha are forced to agree. Elayne then turns to Dyelin, upset and concerned at the lack of guardians and appoints her to take care of any angry Houses that claim she had the four kidnapped.\nThe discussion is ended by the announcement of the entrance of the First Maid and the First Clerk.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

Halwin Norry reports there have been arsons on warehouses storing food the day before. He also says that \"Marne, Arawn and Sarand have all recently taken very large loans against the revenues of their estates,\" which are being used to pay for their mercenaries and bribe some of Elayne's into turning coat, as Dyelin is sure. Elayne orders the mercenary companies to be watched and Birgitte intends to switch them to guarding another gate frequently.\nOnce Mistress Harfor and Master Norry leave, Aviendha says someone tried to listen in with the Power. Birgitte informs Elayne that the Borderlanders are moving, but it may take them well over a month getting close to Caemlyn. Elayne hopes they will come soon enough to drive the six still uncommitted High Seats to her.

The Wise One says she wants to check her condition and the Kinswoman is there to learn from her. She weaves threads akin to Delving, but way more complex, to find out if something is wrong with the mother or the child and learns that Elayne has twins. Sumeko immediately Caresses the Child too, as this is called, once the Wise One is done and Aviendha is to try it as well but as she embraces saidar, the beacon to the west stops abruptly and Sumeko is afraid to know whether something horrible or wonderful happened. Elayne assures her something wonderful happened. Caseille, another Guardswoman, enters with news that the remaining Sea Folk women are in a frenzy, because one of their apprentices has gone missing. Guardswoman Azeri told her she saw Merilille leave three hours ago with a woman cloaked and hooded and tattoos on her hands.

She is irritated over the uncertainty of where she is going to sleep this night, while she imagines Elayne being comfortable in the Royal Palace with \"scores of well-trained servants and likely without two thoughts in her head beyond what to wear tonight at a supper prepared by the palace cooks\". She is certain Dyelin is the brain behind the Daughter-Heir.\nOn her second round of the camp, she encounters another mounted party with Naean at the head. When the other noblewoman sees Elenia, she rides toward her. Naean is certain Elenia is planning to escape and does not wants to be left behind. Elenia has no notion of it yet; if she does, however, she wants a signed letter by Naean repudiating her support of House Marne and swearing to support Elenia for the throne before she is willing to include the other woman.\nNow that she eliminated another claimant for the throne, Elenia is certain other powerful High Seats will flock to her as well. Her good mood lasts until she spots Nasin coming her way, accompanied by his armsmen. He seems to think Elenia's husband Jarid was bothering her and wants to challenge him. Elenia manages to distract him from that thought, when suddenly Arymilla arrives with her coterie. She sends Nasin off with her maid Arlene. Then she invites Elenia, Naean and Sylvase to a repast made by Aedelle Baryn's cook and asks whether Elenia does not mind sharing a tent with Naean. Elenia does not know whether Arymilla already knows about their talk this evening or not. But when Arymilla asks a meaningless question, Elenia is assured of the other woman's brainlessness.

              "pov_summary": "Alviarin has just returned to the White Tower by gateway and is in a storeroom beneath the Tower Library where people rarely go. She has been gone for a month. She is thinking about Mesaana, and how the Forsaken \"hinted at wonders then withheld them\", and how Mesaana uses her like an errand girl; Alviarin is very put out. However, she has great hopes of one day wielding power through Mesaana, and so puts up with it.\nAlviarin makes her way up into the Tower Library, and on her way out runs into a Brown Aes Sedai named Zemaille, who wants to know what she is doing there. Zemaille also makes a remark about how \"it's a sad time for us all and sadder still for you\". Alviarin thinks about questioning and disposing of Zemaille, but notices another Brown nearby.\nAlviarin makes it out of the library and hurries towards the White Tower, on her way to see Elaida to get some questions answered. Elaida is in her apartments with several of the Sitters, and Alviarin is displeased that Elaida would hold a meeting without her present. Elaida tells Alviarin to stand in one corner until she has time to deal with her, and Alviarin is shocked that Elaida would speak to her in such a way. Elaida then goes back to speaking with the Sitters, who wish to enter into negotiations with the rebels. Elaida finally tells them that they may enter into negotiations, but her edict still stands: \"The Blue Ajah no longer exists, and every sister who follows that child Egwene al'Vere must serve penance under my guidance before she can be readmitted to any Ajah.\" Meanwhile, Alviarin is very worried. She is afraid that Elaida knows that she is Black Ajah, and that is why she dares to act in such a way.\nThe Sitters leave, and Alviarin begins to speak to Elaida, telling Elaida that she needs Alviarin in order to hold on to the staff and stole. Elaida replies that she is surprised that Alviarin returned. She tells Alviarin that her threats won't work, because the things that Alviarin has been blackmailing her with are no longer effective: the folly with Rand is blamed on Coiren, and if news gets out about Elaida's mistake with the Black Tower, Toveine will be blamed. Elaida then slaps Alviarin and tells her that she can't wait for Alviarin to be tried for treason, though Elaida still needs to gather evidence. Since Alviarin wasn't around when the rebels appeared, Elaida has asked the Hall to remove her as Keeper, and the Hall complied.\nAlviarin leaves Elaida's rooms in panic, certain that Elaida knows that she is of the Black Ajah. When she gets to her own rooms, she pulls out a ter'angreal in the shape of a small, red rod; it can be used to call Mesaana, but only in times of great emergency.\nMesaana appears, and asks Alviarin what is wrong, saying that she will not help her get the Keeper's stole back. Alviarin tells her, \"Elaida knows. She knows I am Black Ajah, Great Mistress\". Mesaana replies that Alviarin is being ridiculous, because \"Elaida cannot decide from one day to the next whether she even believes the Black Ajah exists. You are just trying to save yourself a little pain. Perhaps a little more will instruct you in your error.\" Mesaana moves to punish Alviarin, but suddenly, the shadows in the room lurch. Mesaana's illusion drops, and her face looks familiar, though Alviarin cannot remember where she has seen her.\nThere is now a Myrddraal in the room, though he is a head taller than any other Myrddraal Alviarin has ever seen. Alviarin reaches for the Source, and nearly screams when she realizes that it is gone; she is not shielded, the Source is simply gone.\nThe Myrddraal tells Mesaana that Alviarin can still be useful, and then tells Mesaana that she had been summoned but did not come. He binds Mesaana and gags her, and asks Alviarin if she wishes to watch Mesaana being punished. Alviarin realizes that the Myrddraal is really the Dark One and replies, terrified, that she does not wish to watch. The Great Lord marks Alviarin as his, saying that now Mesaana will not harm her unless he gives Mesaana orders to.\nAlviarin flees the room, and nearly goes flying down a stairway before stopping just in the nick of time. She is absolutely petrified because the Great Lord has marked her.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

When Pedra leaves, Pevara remarks that Pedra will be raised to Aes Sedai soon, though Tarna doesn't think that she will chose the Red Ajah.\nPevara is wondering why Tarna, Elaida's newly raised Keeper of the Chronicles, is visiting her. What's more is that Tarna seems to be nervous, which is unusual for Tarna. Pevara is suspicious; everything out of the ordinary makes her wary ever since she and Seaine began their search for the Black Ajah. Pevara thinks about how Galina, a known Black, had taken an interest in Tarna when she was a novice; then again, Galina had taken an interest in all novices she thought might choose the Red Ajah.\nPevara asks Tarna if she will take wine in celebration of being raised to Keeper, but Tarna acts as if she would have refused the stole if she could have. Tarna changes the subject, and says, \"I have often heard you called unconventional. I have even heard that you once said you would like to have a Warder\".\nTarna stands and turns her back to Pevara, and begins to speak. She speaks of her trip to Salidar, where she was sent as an embassy from Elaida. She says that she had anticipated no great difficulty at Salidar, but what she found was so disturbing that she raced back to the Tower. On the way, she stopped in a small village in Murandy where there were six Asha'man recruiting men for the Dragon Reborn.\nPevara remarks that \"six men who can channel would be more than merely dangerous for a sister by herself\", and also, accidentally, mentions that she thinks that the situation with the Black Tower it too far gone to put a stop to it. Tarna returns to her seat, and says that she, too, thinks that it is too late. Elaida still thinks that all the Asha'man can be gentled, but if they can afford to send six men to one small village, there are too many.\nTarna then reveals her plan: she thinks that the Red sisters should bond the Asha'man as Warders, saying that the Reds already know how to deal with men who can channel, and that the rest of the Ajahs would be horrified at the suggestion. Pevara asks if Tarna thinks the Asha'man can be gentled after they are bonded, but Tarna does not think this would be wise. She is adamant in her thoughts; \"Red sisters must bond them as Warders. If there is any way, I will be among the first, but it must be done.\"\nThe two of them sit there for a while before Pevara reaches into her belt pouch and pulls out a message. She tells Tarna that it was sent by one of their agents in Cairhien, but it was sent by Toveine Gazal. Tarna reads the message, which is most likely about the Asha'man bonding Aes Sedai at the Black Tower (Robert Jordan doesn't say), and states that it changes nothing. Pevara replies that no, it changes everything.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

After assuring Cadsuane that she didn't go near the Stone, she also adds that the High Lord Astoril is supporting Darlin. Harine has gone \"rushing out to the ships as soon as she could hire a boat, expecting to be declared Mistress of the Ships and set everything to rights\". While Verin speaks, Cadsuane thinks on how Verin is not as vague as she pretends to be.\nMin enters the room, and tells Cadsuane that Rand wishes to speak with her. Cadsuane replies that she will go to him when she is able to. Min leaves, and Cadsuane and Verin speak for a while longer about Rand and Min, and the High Lords of Tear. Cadsuane finally tells Verin that she must go see Rand. Verin makes as if to go with her, but Nesune Bihara shows up and she and Verin end up going off to discuss animals of the Drowned Lands. Cadsuane is troubled that they get along so easily, since Nesune supports Elaida and Verin supports Egwene.\nOn her way to Rand's room, Cadsuane passes a courtyard where the Warders are practising. Lan and Jahar are fighting, and Lan wins every time. Merise, who is Jahar's Aes Sedai, and Cadsuane speak for a while about a number of topics: Beldeine, who is thinking of bonding an Asha'man; Daigian, who has just recently lost her Asha'man Warder; saidin and the taint; and Jahar. Merise says that Jahar is growing stronger in the Power. She also says that Rand gave Jahar the dragon that symbolizes that he has been raised to Asha'man. Merise had to take it away, because \"he is still at the stage where he has to learn to accept only what I say he can\". However, she wonders if she should give it back to him because he is so agitated over it. Cadsuane knows that Merise must be very upset if she is asking advice on one of her Warders. Before she leaves, Cadsuane sees Nynaeve watching Lan and thinks about the relationship between the two.\nWhen Cadsuane reaches Rand's rooms, it is to find that they are guarded by Alivia and Elza. Elza tells her that Rand is seeing someone and tries to keep her out. Elza finally goes into Rand's rooms to see whether he is ready to see Cadsuane. When Elza comes back out, she is followed by Algarin, the man who owns the estate. Cadsuane enters the room.\nRand is very polite to Cadsuane, offering her a chair and wine. He mentions that Algarin had had a brother who could channel, and Cadsuane tells Rand that she was the one who captured that brother and took him to Tar Valon. She thinks to herself that it is \"[a] strange thing for Algarin to be grateful for, in some eyes, but his younger brother survived being gentled for more than ten years after she had helped him reconcile to it\". Rand also mentions that Algarin wishes to be tested to see if he can channel.\nRand then begins to speak about the Seanchan army, which is called \"the Ever Victorious Army\" because while it has lost battles before, it has never lost a war. When they lose a battle, they sit down and work out what went wrong and change it. Rand is worried that it will be difficult to defeat them.\nErian and Sarene suddenly enter the room, with Elza trying to keep them out. Erian announces that her two Warders, who were left behind with many of the other Warders in Cairhien, are on their way. Someone is Traveling with them, because they keep suddenly getting closer. Sarene adds that her Warder is also getting closer, and Elza finally admits that so is her Warder.

Aside from the Warders, there are a dozen Asha'man, including Logain Ablar; there are eight Aes Sedai with them, but all but one seem to be with the Asha'man. Bashere and a hundred Saldaean light horse are also there. Both Bashere and Logain wish to speak with Rand, but neither wants to give the other the opportunity to speak to him first. Min is worried because Logain's aura still speaks of glory, but now stronger than ever.

Loial seems worried about Rand because Rand looks so tired. They all sit down, and Loial begins to speak.

The Great Stump is being called in Stedding Shangtai. Loial says that the stedding in the Borderlands told him to go home and leave matters to older and wiser heads, as did two stedding in the mountains on the Shadow Coast. The rest agreed to guard the Waygates. Before leaving, Loial says that he needs to tell Rand something about the Aes Sedai whom he arrived with, the ones who were with the Asha'man.

He immediately understands why Masema never tried to force the townfolk to give over to the Lord Dragon; breaking into this town would, from the looks of it, require siege engines and patience.\nHe prepares to enter the town with the Asha'man as well as Berelain and the three Aes Sedai - Annoura, Seonid and Masuri - along with his \"secretary\" Balwer. They are followed by a hundred men, representing both Ghealdan and Mayene, to show the inhabitants of So Habor that these are no \"wandering tricksters\", while the Two Rivers men stay with the carts to keep up the cart drivers' spirits. Perrin thinks of it as an elaborate bit of nonsense, fluff and feathers, but he accepts it since he figures that Berelain, being the First of Mayene, and her Aes Sedai advisor should know better than a country boy on such matters.\nAt the closed gates, Gallenne introduces them, asking to see the lord of these lands, throwing in all the titles the gathering are entitled to as well as some more for Perrin. Once inside the town walls, Berelain demands information on where to find the lord or lady, and is told that the Lord Cowlin is away and that they should talk to the grain merchants at an inn called the Golden Barge. Perrin suggests that they go somewhere else, but Berelain replies that there is nowhere else, and that since they are here they might as well go forward. The others seem to take his assent to her words for granted, as they start entering the town through the gates and not in the neat array they approached the gates in.\nThe town of So Habor has cramped winding streets, and even those streets that are quite wide for a town the size of So Habor feel close; there are stone buildings that lean precariously and loom higher than their two or three stories should account for. The streets seem dim, too, and the people scurry around, heads down, not looking at anyone and not breaking the absolute silence.\nEventually they make their way to the Golden Barge, a prosperous-appearing inn from the outside, marred only by the fact that in spite of the morning sun the light seems shadowy. When they enter, however, the image of a prosperous inn is ruined more by the inattention to detail than to the interior of the place. The merchants in the icy room, six men and five women, are shocked and scared when Perrin and the others enter, but their tension eases somewhat when they learn that their visitors are there to trade.\nThe party has agreed in advance that Berelain should handle the bargaining, but Perrin notices that the traders are not very adamant about their bargaining for people touting their wares as the finest. He demands to see the grain in the warehouse, and Berelain quickly backs him up when the traders try to refuse. They take them there, and Perrin cuts open some of the sacks, discovering that there are nearly as many weevils as barleycorn in them. The traders agree to getting only half the price they had agreed on earlier and that they will be responsible for winnowing the sacks, but the negotiations for the price are broken off when a man, moments later discovered as being Kireyin, shrieks in terror outside. The reason for his terror is that he has seen a man go through the wall. Seonid confirms his story, saying that there are dead walking in So Habor and that the Lord Cowlin fled because of it, before asking Perrin to leave either her, Annoura or Masuri behind to do what can be done for the townfolk. Perrin refuses despite realizing that there is something more wrong in So Habor than spirits walking.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

Latian rides up to him then and asks whether it would be alright if Balwer and the others catch up with Perrin's group, because Balwer's friend is not expected back before the next day or the day after. Perrin tells him not to wait too long; he intends to be away within the hour.\nBack at the camp, Dannil, Sulin and Edarra walk up to Perrin and tell him the Maidens brought five Shaido and that Masema is there. At the outer edge of the Ghealdanin camp, Perrin finds four Shaido bound and gagged and another one stretched tightly between four stakes with hot coals on his belly. Perrin kicks them off and asks the Aiel whether he has seen Faile, but the man in question only sings.

Edesina complains about having to be observed by the sul'dam, since she knows how to be careful. Renna wants to collar the Aes Sedai to prevent them from causing trouble, but Mat will not let her. Teslyn says Seanchan soldiers passed through the day before, looking for strangers and clearly malcontent with not being sent east with the rest of the Ever Victorious Army to conquer Illian. As soon as Teslyn is finished, Bethamin tells Mat they can provide him with answers about all he wants to know, since talk of Illian has been common among the sul'dam in Ebou Dar, but they did not know it would interest him. Mat, however, wants them all to stay in the wagons to avoid notice.\nMat thinks Thera is a bigger danger than the Aes Sedai, because she might reveal everything if asked by a Seanchan. He asks Noal to follow her and Juilin. The Aes Sedai and sul'dam report every rumor they snatch up in the towns to Mat, but he doubts them until Thom confirms what they say.\nMat wants Egeanin to go with him to Tuon to smooth things over. She does not want to at first, but then she decides it is best to be over and done with. When Mat enters, Noal remembers a part of the Prophecies:\n\"Fortune rides like the sun on high with the fox that makes the ravens fly. Luck his soul, the lightning his eye, He snatches the moons from out of the sky.\"\nWhen Noal and Olver leave the tent, Mat gives Tuon an expensive necklace, but neither she nor Selucia want it, because it is a \"piece for a shea dancer to wear with her veil\" as Selucia puts it. The woman throws the necklace at Egeanin and tells her to put it on. Tuon asks Selucia what Egeanin's new name should be and Selucia proposes Leilwin Shipless. Tuon agrees.\nThe following nights, Mat works out tactics to interest Tuon the way he would plan battles. Every other time he brings some flowers made of cloth by the show\u2019s seamstress as a present for Selucia. He plays stones with Tuon and manages to win more often than he loses. Once, he brings a beautiful cluster of rosebuds, but he just places it next to the stones board and after playing to a draw, Tuon wants to take a walk. Mat may accompany her \"to make sure she does not run away\". On another day while talking to Egeanin, Mat finds out he has half completed the Seanchan wedding ceremony by naming Tuon his wife three times.\nThe show travels toward a town with hundreds of Seanchan soldiers in camps around it. Tuon and Selucia ride cloaked and hooded next to Setalle on the driver's seat. Mat expects the child-like woman to shout and summon a thousand soldiers down on them. But she surprises him by not saying a word."

Egeanin soothes him by saying Tuon gave her word not to betray them and she will never break that. Outside, Tuon and Selucia are waiting in front of their wagon. Gorderan asks Mat whether he should accompany them and Mat hesitates a moment, before sending him away.\nWhen they leave the show, Mat is almost overrun by a large crowd. He dodges the people and Tuon asks him whether he was practising a dance. When he looks around again, the street is void of people. Inside Jurador, Tuon and Selucia walk from every shop displaying silks to the next. Mat feels the dice tumbling in his head. He spots Aludra in the crowd, talking to a salt merchant. He also sees Edesina when her cowl is swept back by a gust of wind. She hurriedly pulls it up again and Mat hopes no one recognized her face. Two shapes are following her and Mat wonders whether the sul'dam had left only one of them behind to watch two Aes Sedai. He looks around in case the others might be somewhere around, only to realize he lost sight of Tuon and Selucia. Spinning in the middle of the street and taking a random step forward, he finds them again. Throwing his purse on the counter, he tells Tuon to buy her silks here.\nWith a fat bundle slung over his shoulder, Mat accompanies the women back to the show, where Juilin is already waiting for him. He says Egeanin was hurt and he should come quickly. He finds her cradled in Domon's arms bleeding and when he asks for what happened the Illianer replies Renna stabbed her in the back and ran. Teslyn shows up and Heals Egeanin. Mat cannot understand why Renna of all people would go over the edge and the Seanchan woman tells him she was the only one who knows of the sul'dam's secret (sul'dam can learn to channel) and might give it away.\nThe four Redarms in the show ride up and Harnan tells Mat that Vanin is trying to catch up with Renna. Mat then orders Luca to have everyone pack their things and move as fast as they can lest they have the Seanchan on their heels by tomorrow. With that, he and the Redarms ride after Renna. A few miles from the show, they meet Vanin who tells them the renegade sul'dam is pressing hard. When they finally catch up to her, she is not far away from a Seanchan garrison. Mat reluctantly orders Harnan and Gorderan to shoot the woman before she can reach the ridge and be seen by the soldiers. He promises himself never to kill another woman.\nBack in Jurador, they notice the show is still there. Mat enters Luca's wagon to tell him there is no need to run after all and is surprised to find Tuon and Selucia there. Tuon asks him whether Renna is captured or dead and forbids him \"to mourn a traitor\". Luca shows Mat the warrant Tuon signed, which has his show under her personal protection. Tuon tells Mat she made \"specific mention of who is not under her protection\". He notices the little rosebud cluster he had given her was pinned to her shoulder and he starts laughing, because he realized he does not know Tuon at all.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

Egwene asks Nisao if she knows of any link between Kairen and Anaiya, but she does not. She orders her to find out all she can. Egwene leaves her tent to go to her study and sees that most of the Aes Sedai are holding the Power as they walk, which disturbs her. The first visitor, Theodrin, comes with a message from Romanda, asking for a meeting. As Theodrin leaves, she is given a very disrespectful look from Emara, angering Egwene, who asks her if she is showing proper respect. Emara quickly curtsies and passes on a request from Lelaine, also for a meeting.\nSiuan arrives and they discuss things, including the disrespect shown to Theodrin. Egwene says she needs to make sure no one doubts her, and Siuan tells her that everyone now accepts her fully, even if they won't admit it. Sheriam arrives, with a note from Tiana, informing Egwene that Nicola had run away, several days before. Sheriam tells her that Tiana took so long to discover it because her cousins covered for her as they were hoping to see the last of her. The other novices involved are being punished. Sheriam suggests that Egwene tell Tiana to show lenience, but she refuses. She asks her how the other Aes Sedai interpret her dream of a Seanchan attack. Sheriam replies that they are not concerned.\nAfter Sheriam leaves, Myrelle and Morvrin arrive, shortly followed by Maigan, who sends Siuan off to get tea. Morvrin follows her, but Myrelle stays. After Siuan returns, Ragan arrives with a message from Bryne that raiders have crossed with Aes Sedai and that he advises them to stay close to camp. Egwene snaps that Aes Sedai go where they wish. Romanda arrives and tells her the talks are going badly. She suggests the only way to flush Elaida is to send ferrets in after her. This brings no response from Egwene, so she raises the issue of the Kin. She doesn't believe the Aes Sedai could have missed how many there are, or their longevity. Egwene replies that they never realized how many wilders there are among the Sea Folk and that they still don't in truth. Romanda then insists they will have to be hunted down and that they can't allow over a thousand wilders to remain organized. Egwene points out that there are no wilders in the Kin and that hunting them down would not even be possible as they don't look any different from wilders. Romanda replies that if they channeled they would achieve the ageless look. Egwene tells her that the Oath Rod is the only real difference between Aes Sedai and the Kin and that she plans to allow Aes Sedai to remove the oaths and retire into the Kin. Romanda is appalled, insisting that she will die as Aes Sedai. She storms out, but Maigan and Myrelle are uncertain. Lelaine arrives and suggests that Myrelle takes Llyw, Kairen's Warder. Myrelle quickly leaves. Lelaine suggests modifying the Warder bond to make sure the Aes Sedai are in control when they bond the Asha'man. Egwene refuses totally and tells Maigan and Lelaine she will order anyone who does more than suggest it to be birched. They leave.\nEgwene takes Daishar and rides to where Bodewhin is, telling her to stay ashore and that she will perform the task that Bode had been supposed to perform. She boards a boat and rows to the center of the harbour to the iron chain. She embraces saidar in order to convert the chain into cuendillar.

Pevara considers the events that led to Tsutama's downfall to be disgusting. Tsutama reads a letter from Sashalle, in which she reveals that Logain had been Healed and is an Asha'man, that she herself has been Healed and is in charge of the sisters with her and that she and they have sworn fealty to the Dragon Reborn. Sashalle says that she looks forward to re-swearing the Oaths. They reluctantly accept this. Tsutama tells Pevara to move forward with her scheme for the Asha'man.

She leaves the tent and finds her Warder, Tervail, outside watching the men around the tent, since it was a man who could channel who killed the two sisters. She tells him to saddle the horses.\nWhile waiting, she watches the novices. On one hand she finds the change to admit novices older than eighteen difficult, but on the other hand she is sad thinking about how many Aes Sedai have been lost to the age barrier. She hopes for privacy, but, while watching the Sitters leave for negotiations with the White Tower, she is joined by Ashmanaille and Phaedrine. They ask for the Gray sister's advice about the murders. Beonin thinks that the murderer can only be found by finding the connection between the two murdered sisters. Since both were Blue, she makes a connection between Moiraine and Rand, leading her to the Asha'man. Ashmanaille is doubtful of that but thinks that an Asha'man might be able to find the killer. But any plans for an alliance with the Black Tower seem to be halted because the Sitters do not agree on details.\nBeonin and Tervail ride to the Traveling ground. After a short wait they Travel to Tar Valon, close to the White Tower. Tervail wonders what his Aes Sedai's plans are. Beonin hesitates when she sees an Aes Sedai, Turanine Merdagon, who should be long dead, wandering in the gardens, another sign of the Dark One touching the world.\nBeonin starts wearing an Illusion, clearly wanting to enter the White Tower disguised. Tervail thinks she wants to assassinate Elaida and suggests that he should do it. But she sends him away to hire a room in the city."

The former King of Illian was kidnapped to demonstrate the Tower's power. Elaida plans to restore his throne, demonstrating even more power.\nShe calls Tarna, her new Keeper, to deal with Tower business. They talk about the harbours. Elaida wants to avoid fighting with the rebels at all costs. She is looking forward to Gareth Bryne commanding the Tower Guard. Even though she had ordered it, the streets of Tar Valon are not being cleaned. Tarna says that people are afraid to leave their houses, since they've seen the dead walk in the streets. Elaida is furious that she does not have a hold on Rand with Tarmon Gai'don so near. The sewer outlets of Tar Valon are nearly clogged and rats are in the Tower itself. The wards against them must be weakening.\nThe Accepted Anemara brings in Felaana and Negaine. They introduce a woman who wants to present a petition to the Amyrlin Seat. It is Beonin, who lets her disguise drop as soon as she enters the room. She reports how she tried to spread dissension among the sisters in Salidar. Clearly she has been loyal to Elaida the whole time, wanting to bring the rebel sisters back to Tar Valon. Elaida learns that the rebels know that Egwene is alive and not to be tried. Beonin tells her that Egwene can enter Tel'aran'rhiod. Apparently Egwene's discoveries were the main reason for Elaida to keep her alive. Beonin shows Elaida examples of Traveling and Skimming. Elaida wants Beonin to swear that she won't show the new weaves to anyone without her permission. Beonin also tells Elaida the names of the sisters sent back to the Tower to spread tales about Logain and the Red Ajah. The last name on the list makes Elaida sit bolt upright. She wants them watched. One of them is Meidani, who tried to resume an old friendship with Elaida. She wants her invited for dinner.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

Aran'gar finds Demandred, Mesaana and Semirhage deep in a conversation, while Graendal is sitting apart from them, watching. Aran'gar notices that Mesaana looks ill and joins Graendal. The meeting is set in the Ansaline Gardens, probably a place known in the Age of Legends. It was chosen by Graendal, who was the first to appear. The Forsaken are served by undead creatures capable of reading one's mind, called zomara, created by Aginor, who, now going by the name of Osan'gar, had missed every meeting since Shadar Logoth. Aran'gar mentions that Moridin had once been called Ishamael. She suggests an alliance to Graendal by trying to seduce her. Even though she hardly remembers having been a man she is still very attracted to Graendal.\nDemandred confronts Aran'gar with having lost the grip on Egwene. Apparently the Forsaken side with the rebel Aes Sedai in order to keep the White Tower from being reunited. Aran'gar states that Egwene is not the figurehead they think she is. She had been listening in to the Sitting of the rebel's Hall in Tel'aran'rhiod. Apparently Egwene has the other sisters convinced that the Tower is about to fall apart. Mesaana said that she feared to arrange Egwene's flight to encourage the rebels not to end the conflict. She is determined to keep the sisters at each other's throats for as long as possible. Aran'gar starts toying with Graendal's hair, thinking that one's quarry needs to be accustomed to one's touch. She appears to want to manipulate Graendal the way she manipulated Egwene. Moridin enters and breaks up the argument between Aran'gar and Mesaana over who decides when or if Egwene is to be set free.\nMoridin announces that Sammael seems to have resurfaced. He or someone disguised as him sent Trollocs and Myrddraal into the Ways and since they obeyed, it had to have been one of the Chosen. Moridin orders the Forsaken to report any movement of Trollocs outside the Blight and no one is to act on their own until the Time of Return. Demandred notes that the seals to the Dark One's prison need to be found. Moridin agrees and orders everyone to look for them in places where Rand has been. Cyndane suggests kidnapping Lews Therin but Moridin fears she might kill him accidentally. He makes it clear that he will be the one to decide when and how Rand dies. Aran'gar thinks that Cyndane sounds just like Lanfear, but Graendal had said that Cyndane was weaker in the Power than Lanfear.\nIn the end Moridin shows the Forsaken the appearances of Mat and Perrin and tells them to pass on their faces and to tell their followers to kill the two of them.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

Berelain and Annoura are still distanced because Berelain now knows that Annoura visited Masema behind her back. Arganda wants the Seanchan to come, while Aram is doubtful that they will. The \"Prophet\" said they wouldn't. Perrin sees swirling colors when he thinks about Mat, seeing him talking to a small dark woman, but shoves them away, thinking to himself that Faile is all that matters.\nPerrin smells and hears the other party arriving long before the others do. The sign announces a large party of men, perhaps unfriendly. Tallanvor accompanies the Seanchan. He had led the negotiations that had lead to this meeting. A damane is with the Seanchan party. Tallanvor introduces the two parties formally. The Seanchan are lead by Tylee Khirgan and Bakayar Mishima. When she sees him, Tylee is glad that Perrin is not introduced as the Wolf King, because a line from the Seanchan version of the Prophecies of the Dragon says: \"When the Wolf King carries the hammer, thus are the final days known. When the fox marries the raven, and the trumpets of battle are blown.\"\nTylee asks Berelain about her name, which hints at a connection to Artur Paendrag. She would be honored by the Empress for being from the same descendants as long as she didn't claim the land the Seanchan are about to reclaim. Berelain answers proudly that she is indeed a descendant of Artur Paendrag and that she only claims Mayene, which she will defend to her last breath.\nBoth parties have many more men in the woods than was agreed on. Perrin convinces the Seanchan that he, for one, has no reason to ambush them. He further demonstrates the power of his army by having two Two Rivers longbows hit a branch in his hand, which is then burned by one of the Asha'man. The damane with the Seanchan party notices that saidin is being wielded without Perrin having to mention the presence of the Asha'man.\nThe Asha'man and Perrin's proposal to give up any claim on Manetheren convince Tylee to withdraw her forces. The Seanchan blow a whistle to tell their soldiers to leave while Perrin simply shouts to Dannil and Tell to gather everyone and leave as soon as the Seanchan are out of the forest.\nThe negotiations begin with Tylee asking what Perrin can bring to the plan. He does not have trained soldiers but many channelers, male and female, for which he demands a promise that they will not be leashed. Additionally, it will have to be done with his own plan. He tells the Seanchan about the amount of channeling Wise Ones in the Shaido camp. The Seanchan are surprised, since none of the Shaido they encountered in Amadicia had channeling Wise Ones. Perrin tells them that he would need large amounts of forkroot to feed the Wise Ones through the aqueduct above Malden. That can only be obtained by asking a superior, which Tylee wants to avoid. Perrin hands her a piece of paper with a message from the High Lady Suroth herself. It reads that every help needs to be granted to anyone carrying that message, no questions asked. They seal the deal."

Faile thinks about past punishments and intends not to add another one. She wants to seem tamed, but is afraid that if she pretends too long, it will actually happen. She wants to escape before Perrin catches up to them, but at the same time she wonders why he hasn't caught up yet.\nSevanna complains about Galina being punished too much, but she is not concerned about Galina's well being. Galina's state makes it impossible for her to order punishments when they would be appropriate. Apparently all of Galina's hair has been singed off with the One Power. Faile wonders how an Aes Sedai could let herself be treated like that. Galina is sitting between Sevanna and Therava, looking at the latter in panic. She is being treated so harshly that even some of the Shaido say it is too much. She looks broken. Faile worries about Galina not being able to fulfil her promise to take them with her when she leaves. She fears that Galina might betray her to get away from being punished again, even if Faile manages to steal the rod.\nSevanna complains about Galina not being impressive any more without her hair. She offers wine to Therava, who still prefers to drink water.\nFaile worries about having too many people swear fealty to her. Lusara, a Domani merchant, treats their plans for escape like a children's game, jeopardizing everything.\nTherava says that the Wise Ones want to move north and east, since Malden is attackable and food is not easy to come by any more. Sevanna wants to stay because of the good soil for planting, pastures and water. Therava answers that some think Sevanna wants to be captured by Rand to entice him to marry her. Sevanna angrily affirms that she will indeed marry him and unite the clans. Therava doesn't approve of Rand, especially since he revealed the Aiel's secrets, which many of the Aiel believe to be lies. Clearly questioning Sevanna's authority, she points out that Sevanna wouldn't know, since she never went to Rhuidean. Sevanna threatens Therava back by questioning her loyalty and stressing the importance of reuniting the clans. She violently orders that the Shaido stay where they are.\nMeanwhile the new gai'shain enter the tent to relieve the current ones. Faile is replaced by Doirmanes, a Cairhienin nobleman, who is so eager to please Sevanna that he would have to be killed, should he ever find out about the oaths of fealty that have been sworn to Faile. While she leaves the tent, she hears Therava tell Sevanna that Bendhuin, sept chief of the Green Salts, has gotten permission to go to Rhuidean. He will replace Sevanna once he returns. Sevanna is furious at not being informed, but since she is not a clan chief, only speaking for one as a widow, there was no need to tell her.\nFaile walks toward her tent thinking about her situation. Planning has been difficult because Sevanna decides on her servants' tasks at a very short notice. In general, it is difficult to find enough chores for all the gai'shain. There are fourteen septs camped in Malden. The camp holds one hundred thousand Shaido and the same amount of gai'shain. Two more septs, the Morai and the White Cliffs, are arriving shortly.\nMeira, another Wise One, strides towards Faile. She went looking for her because she thought Faile had been dragged into a tent by a drunk. Even though it is against custom, gai'shain are assaulted regularly. Faile and her friends are being protected by Rolan and some of the other Mera'din. Meira commands Faile to tell her everything that Sevanna said and did that morning. While Faile tells her, the two feel reality ripple. Three waves of ripples leave the two in shock, feeling barely existent. Neither knows what just happened.\nIn the tent she shares with Alliandre, Maighdin and Dairaine, a Cairhienin noblewoman, she finds Alliandre tending the wounds of yet another beating. She comforts Alliandre, who is also terrified of the ripples and feeling hopeless. Aravine peeks into the tent, telling Faile that Alvon and his son Theril, two other gai'shain who swore fealty to Faile, have something for her. Theril had a chance to steal the Oath Rod from Therava's tent. He hands it to Faile, who buries it in her sleeve. Faile promises that she will get them out if Galina isn't able to free all of them at once. Alvon doesn't think that Galina is going to free anyone, much less herself.\nThey are interrupted by Rolan appearing out of nowhere. Faile orders the others to leave. Rolan warns Faile that he won't be around to protect her much longer. The Mera'din are thinking about going back to the Three-fold Land. They do not want to follow Rand, but they are appalled by the Shaido as well. He knows of her escape plans. He has no intention of betraying her, but he plans to take her with him if he leaves and to let her go as soon as they reach the first town. Faile now has the oath rod and a promise by Rolan. As she predicted, the gai'shain camp is turned upside down as soon as Therava discovers that her Oath Rod is missing. Luckily, Faile has safely hidden it in the city.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

The dice have started tumbling in Mat's head again and he is eager to get to Lugard but not even the promise of more gold can sway Luca.\nMat decides to go into Jurador since the show is not going anywhere. He's relieved to see no shadows of the dead on the road like he did yesterday. That must be a sign of Tarmon Gai'don approaching. This thought brings back the swirling colours and a view of Rand, and Min, that he could have gone without.\nOnce inside the city walls Mat gets himself breakfast. Passing by a shop that sells swords, daggers and quarterstaffs, he spots a slim black yew stave that would make a fine Two Rivers longbow. Mat buys it without even bargaining.\nMat now moves on to what he came to the town for in the first place. He visits several stables looking for a suitable horse; even with the Seanchan around there must be a few on sale in the town. After visiting a whole series of stables Mat finds the horse he is looking for. Unfortunately, it's a very good breed from Arad Doman called a razor. Mat has only heard of them, never seen one. The owner, a man named Fearnim, knows he has a good horse there and names a very high price. After the customary bargaining Mat buys the horse, even if it is more money than he intended to spend.\nAfter getting back to the show he sees Aludra, obviously having some sort of supply for her fireworks delivered. Mat still hasn't solved the bellfounder riddle.\nAfter taking care of the horse and putting away the stave, Mat decides to call on Tuon. She is in the inevitable company of Selucia, of course, and that of Noal and Olver. Tuon still calls him \"Toy\" and Mat decides to give her a nickname as well - \"Precious\". Tuon seems to think this is some sort of a game but Mat doesn't seem to understand the rules.\nNoal is telling Olver stories, and this time Jain Farstrider, one of Olver's great heroes comes up. Mat wants to know if Noal is related to Jain and Noal tells him that he is his cousin. Tuon, who is unfamiliar with the stories surrounding Jain Farstrider, wants to know who this man is. In Seanchan very few people earn a second name apparently. Olver tells her he was a hero, though Noal thinks he was a fool. Before Noal can elaborate on the matter the door swings open and Juilin reports that a group of Seanchan soldiers is setting up camp nearby.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

Mat verifies that her soldiers have tried to enter the show without paying and she sends them running back to the Seanchan camp. The Standardbearer offers a life of glory and adventure if they sign up with her, but no one takes the offer.

The fool women are channeling in there. Banging open the door he finds Joline, Edesina, Teslyn, Seta, Bethamin and Setalle Anan inside. Bethamin and Seta are standing rigid as fence posts while Joline is slapping Bethamin's face over and over. Mat grabs Joline's arm and she smacks him. Mat, sitting down on the nearest bed, pulls her across his lap and lands hard smacks on her bottom as fast and as hard as he can. Mat's medallion goes cold; Edesina is trying to channel at him, and is shocked when nothing happens. Setalle Anan says that he must have a ter'angreal that disrupts flows of the Power and that Cadsuane Melaidhrin supposedly had one like it and that she would like to see it.\nIt also comes out that Setalle had mentioned testing for the shawl to the Aes Sedai. Joline asks how Setalle knows Cadsuane and about testing for the shawl. Setalle says, \"You may recall that I owned an inn. Many people visited The Wandering Woman, and many of them talked, perhaps more than they should have.\" Joline begins to argue but stops when her two Warders attempt to get into the wagon and she has to shut the door in their faces. Joline next tries to reprimand Mat for the spanking but Mat cuts her off, pointing out that the three Aes Sedai would be wearing collars if not for him and that he will not put up with being hit by any of them. Mistress Anan and Teslyn agree with Mat.\nMat wants to know why they were channeling like it was the Last Battle and Setalle Anan proceeds to tell him. Joline wanted to go see the Seanchan, Bethamin decided to discipline her, trying to pull Joline across her lap with Seta helping her, and Edesina wrapped them up in flows of Air. Mat says that it doesn't account for the amount of channeling he knows they were doing and he gets speculative looks from the Aes Sedai and Mistress Anan. Joline takes over the story, saying that Bethamin channeled a weave that she has never seen before and that she must have been drawing as much of the Power as she could use. Mat asks the Aes Sedai what they intend to do about it. Teslyn suggests that they let her die. Bethamin, crying, says she will never channel again but Joline replies saying that she will inevitably try again and suggests that they teach her enough to make her safe. Edesina and Mistress Anan take Joline's side while Bethamin and Seta, take Teslyn's side on the matter.\nWhile the women were still arguing, Mat takes the opportunity to slip out of the wagon. When Blaeric and Fen ask what happened in the wagon, Mat tells them to ask Joline. Mat, feeling wary with everything going on, goes to sleep on the floor of the wagon he shares with Egeanin and Domon, sure that the next day will have to be better.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

Mat rides Pips alongside the Aes Sedai wagon. The foxhead medallion goes cold against his chest. Mat tries to avoid seeming too eager with Tuon by not riding beside her. At midday they reach Runnien Crossing. Luca shows the Mayor and Village Wisdom, Mother Darvale, around the show.\nThe first night, Mat approaches Aludra. He tells her that he has figured out what she wants with a bellfounder. Aludra needs the lofting tubes to pay back the Seanchan for destroying the Illuminators. She calls the tubes \"dragons\" and the charges \"dragons' eggs\". Mat tells her that he knows someone who can get them made. Mat sees the swirling colors that resolve into Rand talking with Loial. Aludra wants to know who this man is with such power. Mat tells her that it's a secret only Thom, Juilin, Egeanin, Domon, Teslyn, Joline, Vanin and the Redarms know: that the man is the Dragon Reborn. Aludra agrees to go with Mat when he eventually leaves the circus and one set of dice stop rattling in Mat's head. Mat has dreams of death and destruction on a hundred battlefields and the Dark One laughing.\nEgeanin and Domon go into the village, and upon returning announce that Mother Darvale has married them.

Lopin and Nerim are constantly looking for ways to outdo each other while missing their previous employers, Nalesean and Talmanes. Noal tells stories while Olver plays Snakes and Foxes.

Joline and Teslyn get into an argument that clears Edesina, Bethamin and Seta out of the wagon. He notices that the rocks and sparks from Joline have stopped afterward. Joline and Edesina try to bully Mat into handing over the Foxhead medallion. Mistress Anan tells Mat that Joline would face a fairly harsh penance for theft if she took it from him forcefully. She asks to see the ter'angreal. Mat lets her look at it and allows her to touch it. Mat guesses that she was once Aes Sedai and she admits it, telling Mat that her husband, Jasfer, found her sick on the streets of Ebou Dar and took her to his mother. Setalle guesses that Mat is besotted with Tuon. Mat and Setalle agree to keep each other's secrets.\nLuca lets slip to the Aes Sedai that Tuon is a Seanchan High Lady. They begin to harass Tuon about treaties and negotiations with the Seanchan to end the fighting. Lopin and Nerim prepare dinner for Mat, Tuon, Selucia, Noal and Olver. After the meal, Olver leaves and Noal starts telling tales about the Seven Towers in dead Malkier and Shol Arbela, the City of Ten Thousand Bells, in Arafel.\nJoline, Teslyn and Edesina enter the wagon with demands that the Seanchan end the war before Tarmon Gai'don. Selucia slips an a'dam onto Teslyn's neck and in the confusion also slips one onto Joline. Tuon has the bracelets. Edesina tries to get out the door and Tuon wraps her in Air while the door is slammed in Blaeric and Fen's faces. Tuon demonstrates the a'dam on Joline causing her both pain and pleasure. Mat tries to talk her into letting them go but she refuses. Mat moves to free the women and the Foxhead medallion goes cold; Tuon is shocked. Mat releases Teslyn from the a'dam, making the three Aes Sedai agree to leave Tuon alone. Then he releases Joline. Mat buries the a'dam in a deep hole and gets soaked for his trouble. The dice are still bouncing around inside his head.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

Mat sees a flock of ravens fly by and tells Tuon that they can be spies for the Dark One. Tuon thinks it is a children's tale and asks Mat if he believes that, \"if you sleep on the Old Hob's Hill under a full moon then snakes will give you true answers to three questions, or that foxes steal people's skins and take the nourishment from food so you can starve to death while eating your fill?\" Mat is unnerved by the references to the Aelfinn and the Eelfinn. Old Hob, Caisen Hob, was a name for the Dark One in Shandalle where Artur Hawkwing was born.\nMat remembers Egeanin telling him of Tuon being trained at intrigue and dissembling from infancy and can't understand what she wants with him. They come upon a strange looking village with a peddler driving his wagon through it. Mat realizes that the village is an ancient Shiotan village. Suddenly, the peddler and his horses start screaming as they sink into the ground, along with the entire village with nothing left but the road. Teslyn, Edesina and Joline, followed by Blaeric and Fen, start to examine the area and find nothing. The show people are afraid to go on. Luca starts trying to convince them that they need to continue onto Lugard but most just want to head back to Ebou Dar or go west. Thom, Juilin, Amathera, Noal and Olver join Mat. Thom asks Mat if he wants to make a bet on whether Luca will convince the people to continue to Lugard. Thom wins and they head out behind Luca and Latelle at a gallop. Tuon tells Mat that the dead walking is a sign that Tarmon Gai'don is near.\nLopin and Nerim serve dinner but no one feels like eating so Mat sends them to find Harnan and the Redarms and get drunk. Domon and Egeanin invite Amathera and Juilin to join them for wine in their wagon. Things are changing, and people are becoming more accepting. Thom starts reading the letter from Moiraine, so Mat asks him about it. The letter says that Thom should show Mat the letter only when he asks. In the letter Moiraine says that she will be confronting Lanfear soon but she will not die, and also that Thom, Mat and one other person must attempt to rescue her and that Mat knows the way. She wishes happiness for Lan and Nynaeve. The letter also says to remember the game of Snakes and Foxes. Mat is skeptical; he saw the doorway ter'angreal that she fell through melt. Olver says that Birgitte told him that the Tower of Ghenjei is the way to the lands of the Aelfinn and the Eelfinn and that to open the door you take a bronze knife and make the sign of Snakes and Foxes on the side of it anywhere. Noal describes the Tower of Ghenjei and says that it is on the Shadow Coast. Mat recognizes the description as the tower he saw while fleeing Shadar Logoth on Domon's ship. He says that Domon can lead them to it, but he warns them of how the Eelfinn and the Aelfinn may know what is in his mind and tells them the whole story about his encounters with the Eelfinn and Aelfinn.

He was one of the first to join Elayne and he warns her about Arymilla marching against the city. House Pensenor had been allied to Dyelin's Taravin for a long time. People are nervous because of the changes in layout of the palace, a result of the fraying of the pattern. Elayne thought that's why Reene Harfor and Naris were uneasy. Deni recalls that she was more afraid of Eldrin Hackly when he nearly killed her because that danger was real. Birgitte is worried because her earliest memories are fading and she fears losing her memories of Gaidal Cain eventually.\nThey arrive in the Map Room. On the floor there is a detailed mosaic map of Caemlyn, originally laid down more than a thousand years. The map is still pretty accurate, and because of the map Birgitte is using the room as her study. She tells the clerks to leave the room. There is a map on a table. The Black Tower, which is two leagues south of the city, is marked on the map. Arymilla's eight camps and Davram Bashere's camp are also marked.\nElayne removes the falcon that indicates the Goshien camp since they are leaving on Rand's orders. Elayne tells Birgitte to check the Saldaean camp and Black Tower to see if any of them left with the Goshien. A bronze bear fifty miles northeast marks the Borderland army. The two other marked camps belong to Luan, Ellorien and Abelle, Aemlyn, Arathelle and Pelivar and hold close to sixty thousand men. Dyelin has been negotiating with them.\nDyelin arrives, she also notices and is concerned by the palace changes. Branlet, Catalyn, Conail and Perival follow her into the Map Room to hear what she has to say. Perival comes close to figuring out what is going on with the Borderlanders. Aemlyn, Arathelle and Pelivar continue to hope that Dyelin will claim the throne, while Luan and Abelle are noncommittal. Luan and Pelivar helped arrest Naean and Elenia, but that does not sway them now. Ellorien will not budge as she is still furious that Morgase had her flogged while under Rahvin's influence. Elayne is thinking that if Dyelin had decided to claim the throne she'd have more than the necessary ten houses to be crowned.\nThat evening Elayne reads in her sitting room when Vandene visits her with Kirstian and Zarya. She tells her that Reanne Corly was murdered. The murderer left some clues that the fled Kinswomen were killed. Elayne thinks the murderer is trying to frighten Kinswomen into fleeing.

              "pov_summary": "Rand, Cadsuane, Min, Nynaeve and the Maidens guarding them arrive in Tear after being refused entrance at Stedding Shangtai. There are no guards in the guardhouse. The party is in plain clothing so as not to attract attention. They hear a strange noise, a \"rhythmic racketing clatter\" with periodic whistles. The noise startles pigeons, who fly into one another (Rand's ta'veren effect); commoners and nobles alike rush to strangle the birds so they can be eaten. Min has visions of all the people dying of starvation.\nRand and the party see a steamwagon for the first time as it arrives and Rand comments that Master Poel had made his idea work. Two street urchins named Com and Doni tell Rand that they have seen it many times, including seeing four or six hitched together at one time pulling fifty to one hundred wagons from Cairhien. Rand gives the boys gold coins for their information.\nRand and the party continue to make their way into the city, Rand's ta'veren effect causing many strange incidents. Rand intends to go to the Stone of Tear but will not go through the heavily guarded gates as the guards will not let him through in his current disguise and he doesn't want to have to kill men. Rand instead stops at the inn of Agardo Saranche and asks for a room with a good view of the Stone. Rand hears a man talking with a Seanchan accent and demands that the innkeeper tell what he knows of the man. Agardo knows nothing and asks if Rand is sure he only wants one room as he has such a large party. Rand insists one room, the largest, and says its only for the day, he will be able to rent it out again tonight. Agardo tells Rand that all of his rooms with a view are taken and he should go up the street to the The Three Moons Inn.\nCadsuane steps in, pushing back her hood to show that she's Aes Sedai, and tells the innkeeper they will have the room and he should find a way to make the room available. Agardo quickly does so and Rand and the party are soon inside. Rand weaves a gateway from the room into the Heart of the Stone. They startle two guardsmen but fortunately one, Iagin Handar, recognizes Rand. The guards ask if they should fetch anyone for him but Rand tells them he can find Darlin. The guards warn him that the corridors have been changing lately - not being there or not leading to where they are supposed to. Rand assures them he will be fine and sets off in search of Darlin.\nAlanna is in the palace and so Rand uses his bond to find her, sure that Darlin will be with her. Alanna pretends to be surprised when Rand enters the sitting room where she is with several other people, including Astoril Damara, Anaiyella Narencelona, Darlin Sisnera, Weiramon Saniago and Caraline Damodred. Rand is surprised that Alanna didn't inform her company that he was coming.\nRand asks Weiramon and Anaiyella what they are doing there when they are supposed to be in Cairhien. He finds out that they attacked the rebels, causing negotiations to break down. He angrily orders them back to Cairhien. Rand asks why people are starving and is informed that Estanda and the rebels have seized grain supplies and herds of animals. Rand asks that the urchins Com and Doni be found and taken care of.\nBera Harkin enters the room and announces that Sunamon, Tolmeran and the other High Lords and Ladies Rand left with orders to stay in Illian are only a day west of the Erinin. Rand is angry and orders messengers sent to tell them to return to Illian or be hanged.\nBera announces that she has reached an agreement with the rebels. Darlin will be accepted as Steward of Tear for the Dragon Reborn, all laws remain unchanged and the rebels pay to feed the city for one year; in return, the nobles' titles are restored, Darlin is crowned King of Tear and the nobles swear fealty to Darlin, not Rand.\nRand gets angry, again, that the nobles have asked for their titles to be restored. Cadsuane channels a switching and tells him that he will learn to mind his manners. She then advises him to take the agreement negotiated with the rebels as all of his terms have been met. Rand raises a toast to the new King Darlin, who seems a little shocked as there have been no kings in Tear for a thousand years. Bera tells him it was the rebels' suggestion; she says they prefer to swear fealty to him and not the Dragon Reborn. Plus, as Caraline points out, they'll give him titles which will diminish the impact of the title of \"Steward of Tear for the Dragon Reborn\".\nDarlin asks Caraline if she would marry a king; he will accept the crown if she will. Min tells him she knows what his crown should look like. Caraline says he should have Min's crown made and if he looks pretty in it then maybe she would consider it.\nRand tells Darlin that as soon as he is king he should arrest all Seanchan in the city and organize a fighting force to be taken to Arad Doman. Rand allows Weiramon and Anaiyella to accompany Darlin to Arad Doman instead of going back to Cairhien. Rand tells them that they are to prepare for Tarmon Gai'don."

The harbor is full of Sea Folk ships and captured Seanchan ships that Sea Folk have taken over. Harine tells Shalon not to worry - they survived Shadar Logoth and Cadsuane, so they can survive anything.\nHarine and Shalon climb up onto Zaida's ship and are greeted by other Wavemistresses and their Windfinders: Turane, Serile, Lincora, Walleine, Niolle, Lacine, Pelanna, Caire and Tebreille. Lincora and Wallein ignore them, Niolle scowls at them and Lacine seems shocked they are there. Pelanna mockingly asks Harine if she is recovered from the beating she received over the bargain made with Rand. Caire doesn't find Pelanna's questions funny. Harine ignores them.\nHarine is glad to see Mareil and Tebreille. Mareil tells her to ignore the others. Harine recalls that her bargain with Rand was deemed \"deficient\". She had been stripped, hung by her ankles, stretched and tied to a set of rings in the deck and then strapped until she screamed - all in front of the First Twelve and the new Mistress of the Ships. She takes courage from Min's viewing that one day she will be the Mistress of the Ships.\nZaida, the new Mistress of the Ships, and Shielyn, her Windfinder, arrive, with Amylia (an Aes Sedai) in tow. Zaida announces that the man - an ambassador from Rand - has not arrived yet as the women begin finding their seats. Amylia serves wine as a punishment for trying to desert on three occasions, although she does not seem to know the proper order to serve the First Twelve.\nTurane comes in to announce that Rand's ambassador has arrived by a gateway placed a foot above the ship's deck. Zaida tells Turane to send him in, but not to rush. Rand's ambassador turns out to be Logain. Amylia speaks up, saying that Logain is a false Dragon and that to deal with him will incur the wrath of the White Tower. Zaida does not fear that at all and says so. Logain inquires as to whether Amylia's loyalty lies with Elaida or Egwene. Zaida answers for her, saying that Amylia's loyalty is to her for the next year. She asks Logain what Rand wants and where he is.\nLogain refuses to divulge Rand's whereabouts as Rand wants them kept secret. Rand has requested that the Sea Folk fulfill their side of the Bargain and provide ships to carry food and supplies to Bandar Eban from Illian and Tear. Logain says they will be transporting supplies for more than a million people - to the shock of the women - and that they must begin immediately.\nTurane comes in again and, ignoring protocol, runs to Zaida and whispers something in her ear. Zaida is horrified and tells Turane to \"send her in\". She tells Logain that he must wait.\nCemaeille din Selaan Long Eyes enters the cabin with bad news. She informs the women that three weeks ago the Amayar began asking the gift of passage to each of the Sea Folk islands, and all of the Amayar left the Sea Folk ports. When the Sea Folk noticed that none had returned, people were sent to Amayar villages. All the Amayar were dead or dying. They had all poisoned themselves in the belief that the end of Illusion had come and that it was the end of time; this was signaled by the melting of The Great Hand on Tremalking. None of the Amayar could be saved. Zaida says ships must go immediately to every island to see if anyone is still alive.\nLogain agrees that a tragedy has occurred but says that the ships are committed to Rand. Zaida insists the Sea Folk must mourn. Logain tells her that she can \"mourn on the march for Tarmon Gai'don.\"\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

Bodewhin is in her tent straightening things up, mostly Salita's things; Romanda is annoyed that Salita expects Romanda's maid, Aelmara, to pick up after her. Magla was the one who got Salita elected as a Sitter, over Romanda's choice, Dagdara.\nNisao comes into the tent, interrupting Romanda's thoughts; she asks to speak to Romanda alone. Romanda tells Bodewhin that she should leave or she'll be late for classes. Bodewhin leaves, saying that if she is late Sharina would be very upset. This annoys Romanda as Sharina is so much older than novices should be.\nNisao asks and gets acceptance to make their conversation private. Romanda asks if she has learned anything about the negotiations with Elaida. Nisao knows nothing of the negotiations - she wants Romanda to speak to Lelaine, who has demanded that Nisao stop investigating the deaths of Anaiya and Kairen as the murder of Blues is Blue Ajah business. Romanda questions why Nisao is investigating in the first place; Nisao tells her that Egwene asked her to and she will do it because she believes Egwene may be one of the greatest Amyrlins ever if they manage to get rid of Elaida. Romanda agrees to tell Lelaine that Nisao can investigate as she wishes.\nRomanda asks what Nisao has learned of the murders, which is very little. She has learned, though, that Anaiya and Kairen were close friends with Cabriana Mecandes and together, they were called \"the Three\". Romanda thinks that there is something important to remember about Cabriana Mecandes, but tells Nisao to continue to investigate and report the findings to her in Egwene's absence. Nisao reluctantly agrees and leaves.\nTheodrin comes in as soon as the ward is gone and informs Romanda that Lelaine has called for a sitting of the Hall. Romanda begins making her way to the Hall of the Tower. She sees Gareth Bryne and Siuan riding together and wonders at Siuan doing the chores of a maid for the man. She hears a gong sound, another of Sharina's suggestions, which signals the end of a set of novice classes. She sees Sharina talking to Tiana, the Mistress of Novices, and approaches them. Sharina quickly leaves and Romanda asks if Sharina is giving Tiana difficulties. Tiana denies that this is the case; she says most of her problems come from mothers and aunts who are upset that their younger daughters and nieces are learning faster.\nRomanda notices Halima and Delana walking and talking together as Tiana tells her that Sharina is particularly skillful in Healing. This causes Romanda to trip as she is walking as she finds it hard to believe that older women would be able to master the new Healing better than her. She questions why Tiana would let novices practice those weaves. Tiana tells her that that is her decision to make as Mistress of Novices. Romanda mocks her and says that Tiana should go see whether Sharina has any further instructions for her, at which Tiana stalks away.\nRomanda puts the problem of the older novices with talent for Healing out of her mind and enters the Hall of the Tower. The other Sitters are slowly coming in as well. Faiselle says she has convinced Myrelle to try and save Kairen's Warder, Llyw. Romanda asks Lelaine why she summoned the Hall but Lelaine refuses to say before enough Sitters are present to begin. Once the required number is reached, Lelaine begins the session, although she does not ask for a formal sitting. She does, however, ask that the proceedings be Sealed to the Hall. All but the Sitters depart and Aledrin makes the Hall private. Lelaine announces that a Green sister was brought to her asking for Egwene al'Vere and that she thought it best to put the woman's proposal before the Hall.\nMoria brings in the Green sister and her two Warders; Janya asks the woman if she has come to join the rebellion. She says that she has not and announces that she is Merise Haindehl and that she bears an offer from the Dragon Reborn. She asks one of her Warders, Jahar (who is also an Asha'man), to tell the Sitters what the offer is. He steps forward to speak and demands to speak with Egwene. Romanda tells him Egwene is not available but he may speak with them and they will speak with her as soon as possible.\nJahar suddenly snarls and announces that someone just channeled saidin - a man tried to listen in. Aledrin confirms that someone touched her ward, and whoever it was wasn't channeling saidar. When the Sitters discover that Jahar can channel, they bring in Nacelle, a Malkieri Green, to test a new weave she has worked out to detect the channeling of saidin. Her test is successful; the weave works and can detect when saidin is being channeled and at whom. Nacelle is dismissed and Romanda asks Jahar what Rand's proposal is.\nThe proposal is that any sister faithful to Egwene may bond a Soldier or a Dedicated as her Warder, up to a total of forty-seven; they cannot bond full Asha'man or Rand but any Soldier or Dedicated who is asked may not refuse. Romanda calls for an immediate vote. Faiselle expresses doubts over the taint on saidin but Jahar announces that it is clean. The Sitters question Merise over whether his claim is true and she verifies that it is. Romanda again calls for a vote. Everyone but Saroiya and Faiselle vote yes to the proposal to bond and Rand's offer is accepted.\nJanya asks why the number is forty-seven. Jahar explains it is because fifty-one of Elaida's Aes Sedai were bonded by Asha'man, that four Asha'man have already been bonded by Aes Sedai and so forty-seven will even the numbers. He tells them that one Asha'man who was bonded, Eben Hopwil, died defending his Aes Sedai. He tells the story of Daigian, Beldeine and Eben being linked at Shadar Logoth; Eben yelled \"she's channeling saidin\" and attacked a woman with his sword, giving Daigian enough time to drive the woman away. He tells the Sitters to remember Eben's name.\nAt Jahar's insistence that the woman channeled saidin at Shadar Logoth, and given the earlier attempt to listen into the Hall's session with saidin, something clicks in Romanda's head and she figures out that Delana and Halima are Darkfriends and must be arrested immediately. What she was trying to remember about Cabriana Mecandes earlier is that Hailma was supposedly Cabriana's traveling companion. She calls for their arrest but by the time she convinces the Hall that the two may be guilty, they have already Traveled away from the camp.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

              "pov_summary": "Egwene decides that embracing pain as the Aiel do will be the best way to deal with her lot in the Tower. She reports to Silviana her first morning of capture; she cries as she is spanked with a slipper but she refuses to snivel and writhe. Silviana thinks she has done a good job and doubts she will see Egwene again soon. She tells Egwene that she was right - it is Leane in the cells - and she will give instructions that Egwene may visit Leane when she wishes. Egwene doesn't curtsey when she is dismissed, so Silviana orders her back at noon. Egwene announces that the Amyrlin Seat curtsies to no one, to which Silviana replies that she will also see Egwene at supper.\nEgwene is surprised that Alviarin is waiting outside Silviana's office, even more so when she hears Alviarin being punished a few moments later. She returns to her room to tidy herself before going to breakfast in the novice dining hall. Nicola points her out to the other novices as she enters. Egwene makes her way to the food, but is tripped by Alvistere. She lectures Alvistere on her behavior; Alvistere questions what right she has to lecture her. Egwene shocks all of them by announcing she is the Amyrlin Seat, even if she is a prisoner. Egwene notices that a lot of food is going out on trays to Aes Sedai in their rooms; she takes this as confirmation that the Tower is beginning to crumble from within. She eats breakfast calmly, giving no sign that she hurts from her earlier punishment. As soon as she is done, Katerine Alruddin forces her to drink enough forkroot tea that she cannot channel much, but not so much that she will pass out.\nEgwene goes to her first class, taught by Idrelle Menford, who was jealous of Egwene's fast rise to Accepted when Egwene had been in the Tower. She orders Egwene to make a ball of Fire. Egwene responds by making seven different colored balls dancing inside seven rings of Fire, even as Idrelle shouts at her to stop and switches her with Air. Katerine bursts in demanding to know what is going on; Idrelle tells her and Katerine tells Egwene to stop channeling. Egwene stops after a little while longer. Katerine sends Egwene to Silviana's office for punishment; when Egwene walks instead of running, she switches her bottom with Air. Jezrail, another Red, stops her, reminding her that she can't punish the girl. Egwene has two more classes and two more visits to Silviana's study, and Silviana announces that Egwene will need to be Healed every morning. Egwene's classes are also changed to solo sessions with Aes Sedai.\nEgwene visits Leane in her cell; Felaana and Dalevien are watching Leane but tell Egwene that she can speak to her friend. Leane asks Egwene when they will escape; Egwene tells her they won't because she believes she can make the Tower sisters turn on Elaida. Leane asks Egwene if she is certain and when Egwene says that she is, Leane gives in.\nEgwene has a lesson with Bennae Nalsad, a Brown sister. Bennae asks Egwene to demonstrate various weaves and tries to get her to show her the weave for Traveling - which Egwene will not show her. Bennae says that as Egwene seems well versed in the Power, she needs to be caught up on history and asks her to name the mistakes Shein Chunla made that caused the Third War of Garen's Wall, the causes of the Great Winter War and the causes of the Weikin Rebellion. Egwene admits that she doesn't know about the last two, but she states that Shein Chunla didn't make any mistakes and reveals to Bennae secret history of the Tower and the existence of the thirteenth Depository. She tells Bennae that at six different times in the Tower's history, the Hall and Aes Sedai have deposed an incompetent or seriously divisive Amyrlin. This is her strategy with all the Aes Sedai she takes lessons from, to plant the idea of rebellion against Elaida. Sometimes it works, as with Lirene Doreillin, and sometimes it doesn't, as with Pritalle Nerbaijan, Serancha Colvine and Adelorna Bastine. Adelorna tries to break her by paddling her with a hairbrush; when that fails she tells Egwene, a little respectfully, that she wished Cadsuane was in the Tower because Cadsuane would know how to handle her.\nEgwene is learning how to embrace pain; she manages to smile after Silviana has punished her. Attitudes begin to change among the novices. Nicola has been spreading tales of her, making her seem greater than she is. Her refusal to bend gains the novices respect. Novices begin approaching her for advice and for comfort as the Dark One's touch reaches the Tower, making ghosts appear and corridors change. She comforts a girl named Coride who saw a ghost and who is frightened when Pedra cannot find their classroom. She manages to dry the girl's tears.\nEgwene is also kept busy doing chores; she notices that Laras never uses her spoon on her. Chores give her a chance to visit the Accepted's quarters. Several of them, including Mair and Asseil, try to order her around; she refuses to obey them, which gets her trips to Silviana. When trips to Silviana do not make her give in and obey the Accepted, they gradually cease trying to order her around. Attending Aes Sedai gives her further insight into the divisions among the Ajahs and other disasters, such as the sisters sent to take down the Black Tower. She takes opportunities to make comments about how poorly Elaida is managing the city and about the past uprisings of Sitters and Aes Sedai against incompetent or divisive Amyrlins.\nAlviarin approaches her one day when she is raking in the Water Garden. Alviarin hints that Egwene must want to escape. Egwene says that she is content with her situation, which Alviarin doesn't believe. She continues to seek Egwene out every couple of days to hint at escaping.\nOne day she is cleaning hallways and is noticed by Mattin Stepaneos, King of Illian. He recognizes her as coming from the same village as Rand and demands to speak with her. He is being escorted by Cariandre, a Red. He watches as Nesita and Barasine bring Egwene her forkroot tea, which she drinks. Egwene tells him the sisters think the tea will improve her mood. She says he looks well for being kidnapped by Elaida. Mattin says Elaida saved him from murder by Rand; Mattin says he murdered Morgase and Colavaere and a number of Tairen High Lords. Egwene informs him that Colavaere hanged herself and Morgase was murdered by Rahvin. Egwene informs him that he is being fed lies by the Red Ajah and asks him why he has only spoken to Reds. Cariandre tells Egwene to be quiet and sends her to Silviana for punishment.\nEgwene sees Beonin with Melavaire Someinellin and realizes that Beonin must have been the one to betray her. She accuses Beonin of being Black Ajah because she broke her oath. Beonin asks Melavaire to leave them alone. Beonin tells Egwene that she kept her oath until Egwene was captured and made a novice; as she is no longer the Amyrlin Seat, Beonin has convinced herself her oath no longer holds. She tries to say that she betrayed no one but cannot say it. This proves she is still bound by the Three Oaths and isn't Black Ajah. Egwene figures out that Beonin must have betrayed the ferrets. Beonin says she's warned the two Grays but cannot warn the ones of the other Ajahs because of the hostility between Ajahs. Egwene tells her to warn them anyway and to think of it as a penance. Egwene informs her that she is not released from her oath and tells Beonin that she will expect to see her every day in case she has instructions for her.\nLater that day, Egwene goes to inform Leane, who is being guarded by Nagora, Norine and Miyasi, that Beonin was the traitor. Leane says that Beonin is ambitious. Norine tells Egwene she needs to go to bed as she is exhausted. Egwene asks Leane in not so many words whether she is still being asked to reveal the weave for Traveling; Leane replies that she is and says she can see how that means that Beonin hasn't betrayed them.\nThe next morning, Doesine Heals Egwene before her morning punishment with Silviana. She seems impressed that Egwene hasn't surrendered yet but believes that Silviana will break her. That morning after her punishment, Egwene asks Silviana how Elaida can reduce an Aes Sedai to Accepted as there is no provision for it in Tower law. Silviana says there's no prohibition either so it's a loophole; the real problem, however, was that Shemerin accepted Elaida's command. If she'd ignored it, Elaida wouldn't have gotten away with it.

Ashelin fetches her breakfast for her and curtsies to her. The novices have provided her a cushion to sit on. The novices only sit after she has.

Elaida smiles at Meidani and asks her to leave, which she does. Elaida laughingly tells Tarna that the two of them were pillow-friends as novices and Meidani seems to want to renew that relationship; she offers Tarna wine. Elaida is letting Meidani visit because she is letting information slip. Tarna thinks that pillow-friends should be left behind when you are no longer a novice or Accepted.\nTarna notes that Meidani seems frightened. Elaida says that that's good; she wants her to be afraid. She asks Tarna if there is word on the other ferrets. Tarna says there is not and asks if she can at least tell the Sitters why the ferrets are to be watched. Elaida refuses.\nElaida asks if there is any word on the seals of the Dark One's prison; Tarna says that there isn't. Elaida then inquires about the repairs to the harbor. Tarna says that most of the work is being done by Reds. Elaida is infuriated and says that she will have obedience; she dictates an order that the Sitters of any Ajah that fails to send a fair share of sisters to work on the harbors every day will take a penance from Silviana, daily. Tarna tries to suggest that that may not be the best approach, but Elaida refuses to listen.\nElaida questions Silviana's progress in breaking Egwene; Tarna admits that she doesn't think Egwene will be broken but that Egwene will see the sense in submitting soon. Elaida is pleased and says that Egwene will serve supper to her and Meidani that evening."

During their break for lunch Tuon is using sign language with Selucia and laughing over Mat. Setalle says that they're probably insulting him. Mat observes the company. Leilwin and Domon are talking with Juilin and Amathera. Noal is playing Snakes and Foxes with Olver. The Aes Sedai and their Warders are talking with Bethamin and Seta, the former sul'dam. Bethamin has come around and is learning how to channel; Seta was not being taught because she is too old to be a novice until she showered the Aes Sedai with sparks - then Joline and Edesina agree to teach her, though Teslyn won't. Mat's wounds have not yet healed from the fight in Maderin; Tuon thinks that he is foolish for refusing Healing.\nAmathera screams and Mat sees a seven foot snake wriggling away from the camp. Juilin is about to kill it but Mat tells him to let it go as it's leaving the camp and not hurting anyone. Mat tells everyone to clear the area so they can get on the move.\nTuon asks Mat to confirm that the snake is poisonous and he says that it is. Tuon tells Mat that he may kiss her - she calls it a whim \"for a man who lets poisonous snakes go\". Mat kisses her lightly but Tuon tells him not to treat her like a sister or a mother. Mat kisses her again, this time for real and sets out to curl her toes. Tuon only responds by saying he's hot - he must be feverish from his unhealed wounds. Mat doesn't know how to respond to this but refuses to have her put ointment on his wounds.\nTheir argument is interrupted by Harnan announcing that riders are approaching - Chel Vanin and Talmanes. Mat asks what Talmanes is doing away from the Aes Sedai and asks whether he's brought the Band with him. Talmanes says that Egwene is still Amyrlin and about how the Aes Sedai Traveled to Tar Valon. Teslyn demands to know what he means that Egwene is Amyrlin - she's just a runaway Accepted! Mat tells her she can ask questions later and prompts Talmanes again to tell him about the Band.\nTalmanes says that he left them in Murandy and tells Mat that it has grown in size since he left. Mat is furious; he demands to know how he is supposed to pay for that many men. Talmanes tells him that King Roedran has given them enough funds to operate for a year. Mat then introduces Tuon to Talmanes.

Mat tells Vanin that he will have to find another way through. Vanin says that if they go in any other place it's very likely they won't come out as passes through mountains are hard to find.

Aram and Lini have words and Aram leaves, most likely to go to Masema's camp. Scouts found seven thousand Whitecloaks fifty miles from the Seanchan camp heading north. The rumor is that Pedron Niall died fighting the Seanchan and that his successor, Eamon Valda, swore fealty to the Empress. Then Galad killed Valda and led this band in desertion.

Elayne tells them to make sure the Kinswomen are never on their own, always in groups of at least three or four together. Reanne's death makes Sumeko the Kin Eldest, but she is not persuasive enough to make sure the other Kinswomen see sense in that order, so Elayne suggests Alise help her put her foot down.\nJust then, Deni enters Elayne's chambers to inform her of a Red sister's arrival. Before Elayne has the chance to tell Deni that she is not available, Duhara Basaheen storms in and orders Sumeko and Alise to leave. Elayne says they can stay. Duhara is not very pleased, but she tells her the reason for her visit anyway: Elaida wants Elayne to have the Lion Throne and has chosen Duhara to be her advisor. Elayne laughs at the proposal, because she has enough Aes Sedai to choose from, should she ever need an advisor. Duhara counters that they are rebel Aes Sedai and the reason why so many Houses oppose her is because she is lacking the Tower's support.\nWhen Duhara notices Elayne is not going to argue further, she demands someone take her to her rooms. Elayne tells her she has to find room in an inn, because every bed in the Palace is taken. She orders Deni to have someone escort Duhara to the gates.\nA few minutes later, Deni reappears to say Master Norry and Samwil Hark are there to see her. It has been eleven days since Norry last brought Hark. Meeting them in her anteroom, Elayne asks Hark if his return means success. Hark reports that he followed Doilin Mellar to a house on Full Moon Street three times, which is the only place he ever goes to, except for taverns. Norry adds that the house is owned by the Lady Shiane Avarhin. Elayne wants to know if anyone else lives there and Hark says there are two Aes Sedai, Falion and Marillin, at the house that night.\nElayne is delighted to hear that, and tells Deni to fetch Birgitte as well as the Aes Sedai in the Palace, before taking a couple of Guardswomen with her to arrest Mellar. When Hark asks Elayne if she can remove the Finder now that he has done what was expected of him, she answers that he is going to take them to the house first and then they'll see. As it happens, Master Norry can use a man with Hark's abilities. The prospect of having to choose between Baerlon, where he'll certainly take up his old trade of cutting purses again, and Caemlyn, where he'll have a steady workplace, but is monitored by Elayne \u2013 as he thinks \u2013 makes him weak-kneed. Elayne allows him a cup of wine before joining her again.\nShe moves on to the large sitting room, where she waits for the women she sent for. She wonders what secrets this Lady Shiaine has, if she is \"working\" two members of the Black Ajah or what Duhara will do to force her into accepting her as advisor. Birgitte then arrives and wants to know why she was sent for. Elayne tells her of her plan to capture two of the Black Ajah, but Birgitte tries to argue her out of it. One after the other, Vandene, Sareitha and Careane arrive and want to know what they are talking about.\nWhen Elayne explains her plan again, their reactions vary. Vandene likes the plan, the Warders do not want to let their Aes Sedai enter the House alone, Sareitha says they can't be sure whether Falion and Marillin are still there or whether others have joined them and Careane thinks it is dangerous trying to sneak up on someone who has a variety of stolen ter'angreal. Elayne thinks it is a pity both Sareitha and Careane object, because otherwise it might have been a clue as to which of them is Black Ajah.\nWhen they finally ride out of the stableyards, Elayne hopes Falion, Marillin and one more will be arrested by dawn. Upon arriving at Full Moon Street, Vandene sends her Warder Jaem over to check if anyone is still awake. He ties up the drunk he finds in the stableyard and returns to report that all windows except for the one facing the street are dark. Preparing to go in, Elayne reaches for saidar and says she'll meld the flows for Sareitha, while Vandene does the same for Careane. After linking with Sareitha, Elayne masks both their glows and prepares some inverted weaves.\nAs they enter the house, Elayne keeps an eye on Sareitha, while Vandene does the same with Careane. Once all of them reach the sitting room, Elayne places shields on Falion and Marillin and binds them and Shiaine with flows of Air. Just as she is about to arrest the three of them as Darkfriends, Asne, Temaile, Chesmal and Eldrith suddenly appear to rescue their companions.\nTemaile says the only one they need is Elayne, and Marillin suggests that they spare Careane from being killed, because she is also Black Ajah. Hearing this, Vandene stabs the Green in revenge for her sister's death. Chesmal then kills both Vandene and Sareitha with the Power, before stating they'll have a little more killing to do when their Warders arrive.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

The other Warders note that their bonds also feel odd. A few minutes later, the male Warders speed off into the night, ready to take revenge on the Black Ajah, because they have felt their Aes Sedai die.\nThe Guardswomen want to join them, but Birgitte stops them in their tracks, letting them know that Elayne is still alive and that they will need more swords to rescue her. They ride back to the Palace as fast as they can. Upon arriving, Birgitte sends off Sanetre to get Guybon and Hadora to have the Windfinders meet her in the Map Room.\nWhen Birgitte reaches the meeting room, Guybon and Dyelin are already there, studying maps that are studded with red discs showing where the city is being assaulted. Birgitte asks Guybon to give her every horse and halberd he can spare and tells them what has happened. She calculates that the Darkfriends will have passed the gates by the time they will be ready to move, so they are going to Travel to the site. Dyelin, however, puts in that a few hundred men will have to suffice, unless she wants to give Arymilla Caemlyn.\nBirgitte informs Guybon what exactly they will be facing, which does not diminish his determination to get Elayne back. Just then, a Guardsman enters to announce that Julanya Fote and Keraille Surtovni have returned. They report that Ellorien, Luan and Abelle, as well as Aemlyn, Arathelle and Pelivar are moving towards Caemlyn. Birgitte estimates they will reach the city by afternoon and Dyelin is sure Ellorien was able to convince the others to support her for the Lion Throne.\nChanelle then enters with the other Windfinders in tow, complaining about having been threatened, before Birgitte interrupts by telling her Elayne has been kidnapped and they are going to provide them with a gateway big enough for thousands of men and horses. Chanelle is indignant at first, because according to their bargain, the Windfinders are to take no part in any kind of fight, but Birgitte assures her that Arymilla won't care about their bargain if Elayne is lost. Out of fear of Zaida's wrath should she fail the bargain, Chanelle grudgingly agrees to transport them only.\nAlong with her one hundred and twenty-one Guardswomen, Birgitte arrives at the Traveling grounds, where close on twelve thousand soldiers, more than one thousand Guardsmen, and the young lords and ladies who came to support Elayne with their armsmen are already waiting. Just as Chanelle asks where exactly they are going to Travel, Mistress Harfor comes running up to Birgitte with a wounded soldier, who reports that three or four mercenary companies are attacking the Far Madding Gate from the inside. Quickly, Birgitte decides that the cavalry and one thousand halberdmen will have to suffice and tells Dyelin to take the rest and scrape together every man capable of holding a sword.\nOnce the Black Ajah notice soldiers appearing behind them, they begin hurling lightning bolts and fireballs at them. Birgitte makes Chanelle watch the scene in front of them and tells her Elayne will be lost, and with her the bargain, if she does not help the soldiers. After a moment's hesitation, Chanelle strikes down the woman holding the rod that produces balefire (Asne Zeramene) and shields the others.

Elayne has nine Houses supporting her, but she needs ten, and her army is smaller. Finally she decides to write the safe conduct for Lord Luan Norwelyn, Lady Arathelle Renshar, Lord Pelivar Coelan, Lady Aemlyn Carand, Lady Ellorien Traemane and Lord Abelle Pendar and requests an audience in the afternoon to discuss the Borderlanders. When Hanselle leaves, Elayne asks Dyelin if she would accept to become the Queen, but Dyelin refuses, saying that Elayne is the Daughter-Heir and that her connection to the Dragon Reborn may be useful.\nMistress Harfor makes a report on spies, and Master Norry explains that neither the Black sisters nor Daved Hanlon will give useful information. Elayne suggests to request the loan of Lady Sylvase Caeren's secretary who is an experienced torturer.\nElayne has lunch with Birgitte and they discuss the uncommitted nobles. Birgitte used to drink too much to dull the pain of losing Gaidal Cain, but now she has given up because of Elayne's babies.

Luan still wants a truce to deal with the Borderlanders. Elayne explains that the Borderlanders should be peacefully leaving for Murandy, and how she dealt with them, using her rank of Aes Sedai. Ellorien has to admit that Elayne did right. Abelle asks then if Elayne has plans to deal with the Black Tower. Elayne won't do anything except having them watched to ensure that they respect Andoran laws. After a long pause, Abelle and Luan say they stand for Trakand.

The Aes Sedai are there too, with the former sul'dam, though they remind him that they will not participate, except when they feel they are in danger.\nWhile waiting, Mat thinks about being married, but vows to himself not to give up gambling and dancing. He wonders how Tuon marrying him will help the Seanchan Empire. He also thinks about the men teaching Olver to fight and Aludra putting herself in harm's way by wanting to light the strikers of her explosives herself. Also there are the three Aes Sedai and two former sul'dam, there more so to view than to actually fight.\nMusenge of the Seanchan Guards comes over to Mat and offers Mat his \"opinion\" on what Mat's men should and should not be doing, because they are idle at the moment. Mat explains that the work that was completed was what Mat had wanted done, because he wanted the approaching army to think that they were caught unprepared. However, Mat has a trap ready for them.\nMusenge also comments on the size of Mat's army, wishing that there were more men for the task. However, Mat states that he has what is needed. Before Mat can ask why Musenge is calling him \"Highness\", the scouts returned and Mat starts staging his men for the battle.\nVanin provides Mat with his report on the approaching army, while Mat views the readying troops. Soon enough they hear the bugle of the approaching army and finalize getting into position. Mat even has the banner unfurled, so the oncoming army can see whom they are fighting this day. He makes sure one last time that Aludra is ready. The lancers on horseback start advancing to face the oncoming army, and then when they are in the last stages of the advance, Mat has Aludra let loose with some of her tricks, and then the horsebowmen start advancing into position and begin to fire their bows and men and horses alike begin to fall. However, the Aes Sedai do not feel they are in danger yet, and so cannot help. The two former sul'dam want to try to help, but are subdued by the Aes Sedai. As arrows keep flying and coming closer to Mat and the Aes Sedai, the men regroup and the slings come out. Then Mat feels the arrows close in on him and one rips each sleeve and one rips the shoulder of his coat. Finally the Aes Sedai feel threatened enough to respond and begin hurling fireballs at the advancing army. Then the fighting dies down and all is quiet. The Seanchan Ogier with Mat begin climbing over the bodies in an attempt to find one Seanchan soldier in the Seanchan led army, because there is a traitor to Tuon and the Empire that they must find. The Aes Sedai advise Mat that he owes them a debt because they helped end this skirmish.\nMusenge informs them, not too nicely, that the crossbowmen settled it. Then he asks Mat if what is left of the Band and the losses were all he had, to which Mat replies that he always had enough men for the task. Then Mat responds with his own question of Musenge - Why does he keep calling him \"Highness\", when he has undoubtedly earned the right to call him Mat through helping in the fight. Abashed, Musenge replies that calling him by his given name would lower his eyes forever because when Tuon completed the marriage ceremony, Mat became Prince of the Ravens. In response, Mat lets out a laugh because he has just realized that he has became the one thing he despises, a Noble.\n<< Previous Chapter / Next Chapter >>"

Pevara resists thinking of them as novices and Accepted: their training routine, where they are pushed to their absolute limits as soon as possible, is so different from the safe and steady guidance of the White Tower.\nAfter learning that they want to be taken to see the M\u2019Hael \u2013 Mazrim Taim \u2013 the Dedicated is startled to realize that they are all of the Red Ajah. He leaves through a gateway to inquire after permission, and the Aes Sedai are left in the care of the two soldiers. Pevara is hesitant to use the word \u201cM\u2019Hael\u201d as it implies that Taim is leader of everything.\nSaml al\u2019Seen seems barely old enough to have left home, and Desala addresses the issue to him. Enkazin responds that he\u2019s a fast learner, and as al\u2019Seen's chest swells with pride the Aes Sedai decide that they will bond no children. Definitely no children.\nAfter half an hour of seemingly unconcerned waiting, the Dedicated returns with news that the M\u2019Hael will see them. He does not, however, show them the way. His reason is that \u201cthe M\u2019Hael doesn\u2019t associate with the likes of [him]\u201d. Pevara stores this intriguing statement for later thought.\nA Tairen Asha\u2019man meets them on the other side of the gateway and leads them to the M\u2019Hael. He takes them into a small palace adorned with tapestries of battles and into what must be the throne room, where a ring of columns supports the palace\u2019s largest dome. Around a hundred Asha\u2019man stand to the sides of the room.\nTaim lounges on what can only be called a throne, and his air of physical strength and darkness draws their attention. Instead of wearing the collar pins of the other Asha\u2019man, blue and gold embroidered dragons circle the arms of his coat.\nTaim asks the sisters what six Aes Sedai of the Red Ajah want with the Black Tower, and cuts Pevara off when she starts introducing them. He wants reasons, not names. Pevara says that they want to bond Asha\u2019man as Warders, but only with the man\u2019s full permission, unlike the situation of the Red sisters already bonded by Asha\u2019man. One of the Asha\u2019man around the room speaks out against this and Taim hits him over the head with the Power, knocking him to the floor. A fellow Asha\u2019man attests that he still lives, but Melare\u2019s offer of Healing is refused. This is the discipline of the Black Tower.\nAfter further explanation of the bizarre request Pevara is making, Taim curtly grants the Bond of any man who concedes. Pevara is surprised at the brevity of his decision-making, and Taim replies; \u201cLet the Lord of Chaos Rule\u201d. His laugh is echoed by the men standing around the room and makes the hair on the back of her neck stand up.\n<< Previous Chapter / Next Book >>"

              "pov_summary": "Meidani has finally summoned Egwene, but first she is taken to Bennae's room, the first time she has been to the same Aes Sedai twice. Bennae has her perform some weaves, with which she has no problem and then says she wishes to see if Egwene has the sharpness of mind required of an Aes Sedai. She asks how Egwene would react if she were in conflict with her Ajah because she had come into some information she wasn't supposed to know. Egwene realises Bennae is talking about herself. She tells Bennae that from the perspective of the Ajah leaders it would suggest a leak amongst their most trusted members. Egwene says she'd explain where the information really came from and offer them a solution, that they make her one of the caretakers of the information. Bennae bows her head in thanks, even after Egwene calls her by her name.\nAfter leaving Bennae, she is taken to Nagora, who frames a request for advice on dealing with an aging Warder as a logical puzzle. She is also impressed. Next, Egwene is taken to Suana, the first Sitter she has dealt with. Suana tells Egwene they would like her in the Yellow, even with her lack of Healing ability as being Yellow is about making and fixing things, not just Healing people. Egwene takes the opportunity to reach out to her about healing the divisions within within the Tower, suggesting that Sitters of different Ajahs might begin taking meals together, or walking in each other's company. She leaves, again without punishment to go to Meidani's room.\nMeidani tells Egwene she is not certain how she regards her, having been captured and overthrown. Egwene tells her she is still Amyrlin and knows for a fact that the rebels haven't chosen a replacement. She demands to know why Meidani did not flee the Tower when Elaida discovered she was a spy, but Meidani tells her she cannot say. Egwene realises the Three Oaths are involved and asks if Meidani can show her instead. She has Meidani promise that she accepts her leadership and that she will not reveal the weave to anyone, and shows her how to Travel. They go through the gateway, hearing rats and Meidani warns her it could be dangerous. They go to one of the rooms and see Saerin, Yukiri, Doesine and Seaine.\nEgwene realises they had made Meidani swear a fourth oath and calls it insanity. Saerin replies that it was necessity, not insanity. Yukiri threatens Egwene, barely in control of her anger, but Egwene replies that the rebels are not to blame for the divisions within the Tower. Seaine tells Egwene they are looking for the Black Ajah. Egwene decides their plan is reasonable, but that making Aes Sedai swear the oath of obedience is not. Egwene questions them and Yukiri tells her she will set penance until she runs out of tears. Egwene tells her it can't be any more than she has already and that even if it was set, it would draw attention to the group. Seaine says they would get Meidani to do it, but Meidani and Egwene both say she accepts Egwene as Amyrlin. Yukiri says they could order Meidani to do it, but Egwene reminds her the fourth oath was supposed to prevent Meidani from betraying them, not to control her in a way just short of compulsion. Yukiri continues her refusal to deal with Egwene, but Saerin insists they do as Egwene won't stop otherwise.\nShe tries to persuade Egwene to relent, firstly by pointing out that the forkroot makes her weak. Egwene makes her concede that an Amyrlin's power does not come from her ability to use the One Power to force people to her will. She then suggests that Egwene has been demoted to novice, but Egwene says she simply refuses to accept that and it should never have been allowed in the first place. Saerin tells her that if Elaida hadn't done it, Egwene would have been executed and Egwene replies that sometimes she thinks it might be better to be dead than to see what Elaida has done to the Tower. Seaine takes over, saying that as Elaida was properly raised, Egwene can't be Amyrlin. She asks Seaine if they found any Black Ajah amongst the Sitters. Doesine admits that they did, realising Egwene's point, but Egwene makes it anyway, that as any Black Ajah vote is invalid, Siuan was deposed and stilled illegally. Yukiri claims that is pointless as if they accepted it they would have to second guess every Amyrlin who was ever raised, but Egwene reminds them that Elaida was raised by a bare minimum and that others, including herself were raised by the full Hall.\nShe tells them she is impressed with the way they have worked together that they are to release Meidani, who she tells to continue working with them. She says they have a more important task, to work on healing the divisions within the Tower.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

He is even more surprised to hear Katerine mention Egwene, who she says has been captured and made to howl half the day for calling herself Amyrlin.\nGawyn follows them outside and there confirms with Tando that no-one saw her enter the building.

Egwene says she would have sent sisters to Rand's home village to learn what sort of man he is. She tells them she knows Rand to be a good man at heart and would have sent sisters to offer guidance or spies if he rejected them. She tells them he has restored order to Cairhien, Tear and Illian and gained the respect of the Aiel. Ferane interprets this that Egwene would let him sow chaos, but she says without information, what Elaida did was lunacy.\nFerane tells Egwene that she still has not said how she would deal with the situation. She says she would send three Aes Sedai to honour him, a Gray, a Blue and a Green. Tesan is impressed with her logic. Egwene says that Elaida's delegation is flawed because it was sent by a Red and that she can't see the logic of raising a Red to Amyrlin in the days of the Dragon Reborn, as they \"deal with\", not \"work with\" men. Ferane sees the sense in this.\nEgwene mentions that because of Elaida's bungling he has taken some Aes Sedai captive and allowed others to be bonded by Asha'man. Egwene tells her that they can't deal with Rand until the White Tower is mended. Ferane says that by continuing to claim to be Amyrlin, Egwene maintains the division. Egwene replies that even if she renounced the role and persuaded the rebels to accept Elaida, the internal divisions would still hold. Miyasi claims the Whites didn't cause the tension, but Egwene says it is only logical given Elaida and the Hall's actions. She persuades them to reach out to other sisters. She tells them that Suana of the Yellow will invite them to dinner with her and they should accept and take it in a public place. Ferane tells her she would find a welcome in the White.\nShe leaves and Katerine doses her with forkroot, telling her that she is to have no more lessons and instead will just do chores. In the kitchens, Laras takes her to a fireplace to store her until night when she intends to help Egwene escape. Egwene refuses saying that someone has to fight Elaida. After her duties, Katerine tells her she is to attend Elaida that night. At dinner, Egwene sees there are five other Aes Sedai, a Sitter from each Ajah apart from Blue and Red. Shevan says that the rebels must be given a chance to reconcile. Elaida refuses and insults first the Gray, then Rubinde. Shevan mentions the Seanchan and Elaida says there is no need to worry about them. She instructs Egwene to say she has been spreading lies but Egwene tells the truth, that she is a Dreamer and that the Seanchan will attack the Tower and are a serious threat. She is told to bow or Elaida will use the Power to make her. Egwene asks if she intends to control everyone that way and brings up the fourth oath Elaida had considered. Elaida starts to weave a gag of air, but Egwene says an Amyrlin should be able to persuade her opponents, impressing Yukiri. She quotes Balladare Arandaille on the role of an Amyrlin, impressing Shevan and asks Elaida what she had intended to do with Rand if she had succeeded in capturing him and asks her how she expected him to fulfill the prophecies. She says she has been trying to heal the scars within the Tower while Elaida has been bullying Sitters and insulting Ajahs. Doesine murmurs agreement and Elaida realises she has lost the discussion and ends it.\nEgwene calls her a coward and says she would also name her a Darkfriend but imagines the Dark One would be ashamed to be associated with her. Elaida loses control, calling Egwene a Darkfriend and lashing out with the Power. Rubinde tries to stop it, but Elaida forces her down.

Mat is expounding on how impossible women are using a game of dice as an example. Vanin rides up with a map in his hand. Mats asks if Vanin has figured out where they are and Vanin is not sure. It depends on what mountain it is that is ahead of them but he thinks he knows where they are. Mat lets Vanin ride off to scout thinking to himself that if Vanin were to spy on an enemy army he'd get close enough to count the whiskers on the camp guards' beards and make off with their stew, too, all without being seen.\nAs Vanin leaves, Mat hurries to catch up with Talmanes and thinks to himself how ridiculous the Cairhien man looks in his Cairhienin clothing. Even if the man was loyal and had excellent taste in wine, he still had horrid taste in fashion. Talmanes mentions the Band's great victories but Mat says that one thousand men buried is not a victory. Talmanes says losses are inevitable. Mat says there are only losses when one fights. Talmanes asks why Mat fights so often then, and Mat says he only fights when he cannot avoid it. Mat thinks to himself how impossible noblemen are; even decent ones like Talmanes.\nThis sets Mat to thinking about his own title he got by marrying Tuon. He wonders if the Seanchan will pursue him. He knows Tuon knows what his Band is capable of. Then he wonders if Tuon loves him. Yes, she did stay with him when she could have escaped but if it were best for her Empire he is certain she would attack him. Thinking about Tuon's narrow escape from Seanchan soldiers after the reward money placed on her head fills Mat with conflicting emotions about letting her go and he mentions it. Talmanes says Mat did give his word and the Captain of the Deathwatch Guard wouldn't have taken it well had Mat tried to keep her. Mat is not reassured and Talmanes tells him he's sounding husbandly; Mat does not take well to this.\nMat asks Talmanes if he's ever been in love or wanted to marry. Talmanes says he's been in love several times but never married, thank the Light. Talmanes realizes what he just said and tries to soothe Mat saying Mat's marriage will work. Mat thinks about how inconvenient his marriage to Tuon is and says that no matter what he won't stop gambling or drinking. Talmanes teases him about this with a straight face but humor in his eyes. Mat says he isn't going soft no matter what anyone says. Talmanes says some of the greatest generals alive are married.\nMat tells Talmanes that when they get to town he and Talmanes are going dicing. Talmanes objects because of the inferior wine but Mat insists. Mat checks briefly on Olver who is riding with Noal, listening to one of the man's tales.\nVanin returns and confirms their position and says there's a town just over the ridge. Joline overhears and she, Edesina and Teslyn ride up to him. Talmanes stops the army so they can talk. Mat refuses to think of Joline, a Green Aes Sedai, as pretty because if he did he would end up wrapped around her little finger or even bonded to her as she has hinted before. He wonders if she is still angry at him for paddling her. Mat looks at the other two Aes Sedai and thinks that Edesina, a Yellow, is pleasant-appearing enough but that Teslyn is about as appetizing as a stick though she shows respect to Mat - even more suprising because she is a Red.\nJoline demands of Vanin if he knows where they are. He affirms rather crudely but rephrases politely after she stares him down, to Mat's dismay. Joline is pleased there is a town nearby because there will likely be an inn and decent food. Teslyn asks how far they are to Caemlyn, ignoring Joline who ignores her in return. The two have been squabbling for weeks although they were displeased when he referred to it as such. Mat and Vanin agree that Caemlyn is about two hundred leagues distant from their present location. He plans to go to Caemlyn to resupply and get information before going to the Tower of Ghenjei with Thom. Teslyn asks how long it will take to get to Caemlyn. Vanin says a little over a week without the Band, on familiar territory and with an extra horse or two. With the army, which cannot cut through the forest, he says it will take at least twenty days. Mat says he won't leave the Band behind. Joline then demands twenty horses for herself, Edesina, Teslyn, Setalle, the two sul'dam and some pack horses, also grain, coin for inns and a handful of soldiers to care for the horses.

He tells her that Arad Doman will have to deal with the Seanchan without him but that he will remove Graendal from their land first. He tells his Maiden guards that he goes to battle and that they should bring no more than twenty. While they are going to get the twenty, he sends a servant to fetch Nynaeve and Ramshalan. He tells Min about Natrin's Barrow. When Ramshalan arrives, Rand asks him what he would do if he had an enemy cleverer than he was. Ramshalan says he would make an alliance. Min doesn't trust him, and worries that he would turn against Rand if it suited him. Nynaeve asks Rand why he had her there, if he is so sure and he says it is because what he is about to do should frighten him. Rand opens a gateway and goes through, Natrin's Barrow visible. He sends Ramshalan down, telling him to determine who the inhabitants are and to negotiate with them to try and win them to Rand. He tells Nynaeve that he expects Graendal will use compulsion on Ramshalan and try and use him.\nSome time later, Ramshalan returns and Rand has Nynaeve examine him, to determine if he is under compulsion. She tells Rand he is. The sun sets, and Rand draws saidin through the access key, terrifying Min before weaving balefire and destroying the fortress and all within it. The forest seems to groan and the substance of the world feels close to breaking. Nynaeve is furious, but Rand has her test Ramshalan and she determines the compulsion is gone, the balefire having killed the person who set it, before they did. Rand tells Ramshalan that he has been a help and that as a reward, he will not execute him for claiming to his friends that he could manipulate Rand. Rand sends him south, telling him there is a village a day or so that way, before opening a gateway and returning.\nMin and Nynaeve discuss what has happened, worried that Rand may have gone too far, but also worried that it might be the only way and that if he had been that hard from the beginning, many lives might have been saved. Nynaeve decides that if Rand faces the Dark One as he is, his victory might be a terrible thing. She says she wishes Moiraine were there, but as she is not, she decides that Cadsuane was right and goes to see her. Merise tries to turn them away, but Nynaeve tells them she saw Rand balefire a fortress and Cadsuane tells Merise to let them in. Sorilea is inside and tells them they felt the world warp and asks what happened, so Nynaeve tells them the details, after which Sorilea dismisses them, but Cadsuane persuades them to let Nynaeve stay, on condition that Nynaeve can be obedient.

She gives Egwene two books, one of which has details on all the darkfriends and their plots Verin identified including the majority of Black Ajah members, and the second book is the code to translate the cipher of the first. She then gives Egwene a ter'angreal, which when wrapped around the books, turns them invisible.

Bryne\u2019s company is engaged with a smaller Seanchan troop, but the fight is not as easy as the numerical advantage would suggest. As the fighting abates, Bryne finds Siuan missing, although he is reassured of her well being by the warder bond.\nSiuan re-appears with a novice in tow. Hashala, the novice tells of how Egwene was released from the cells earlier in the day and is now probably in the novice\u2019s quarters, on the 22nd floor, where the Brown Ajah quarters used to be. She also sees that this is a rescue attempt and asks to go along as she and almost all of the novices are loyal to Egwene. The decision to take her along is a relief to Bryne, who would have rather not left her tied up in the middle of this battle.\nWhen Bryne gets the casualty report from this action he is distracted for a moment by the destruction wrought upon the once majestic structure of the White Tower. The losses are not too serious although he is again saddened by three men who will not survive to receive healing. Siuan picks up this through the bond and Heals the dying men. As the Healing is in progress a Seanchan Bloodknife attacks and is killed by Bryne thanks to his bond enhanced awareness and reactions. The Seanchan pushes Bryne's sword arm away and dies. Siuan is reminded of Min\u2019s viewing about her being in danger if Bryne is not with her. Remembering the viewing properly Siuan delves Bryne and discovers a poisoned needle that the Bloodknife had stabbed him with when he pushed Bryne away. Siuan Heals Bryne and tells him of Min\u2019s viewing."

Mat slightly injures the gholam and the gholam tells him it has also been instructed to kill Thom, Noal, and Tuon to draw Mat out which startles Mat enough that it leaves an opening that the gholam tries to take advantage of but Teslyn shows up and uses weaves of air to tear the knife out of the gholam's hand and pull Mat backwards. Teslyn uses weaves of air to throw furniture at the gholam which scares it off. As the gholam runs away it encounters a couple of Redarm guards, Gorderan and Fergin, and easily dodges them and tears their throats out. Mat returns to his tent to see whose blood was there and discovers Lopin, Riddem, and Will Reeve dead. He then searches for Olver and runs into Noal who tells him Olver is sleeping on his floor.\nAn hour later Mat tells Noal and Thom about his encounter with the gholam and warns them of its threats towards them.

He then tells her he wants her to tell the Amyrlin that the White Tower has something of his and he will be coming to claim it and better not be bloody turned away. She tells him she will do it. Mat nods to Vanin who he is sending to Tar Valon to gather information. As Mat and Thom walk away Thom asks Mat about the sweetbuns. He tells Thom he put sprinklewort in them and it will turn her mouth blue for a week. Mat goes to meet Setalle Anan who tells him he needs a shave. He asks her to watch over Olver for a while when he goes on a trip and he says in return when he gets someone who can make gateways he will send her to Illian to find her husband."

Alise points out that these could be used to make a profit and that the Kin will want half of whatever is made. Elayne replies and tells her that Healing will be free for everyone. Sumeko says it is not up to her but Alise replies it is her choice and anyone who decides to follow her as the Kin is not what it was and Sumeko will be joining the White Tower.

Rosil shows her a six pointed star that she is supposed to go to when she sees it. She tells her she is supposed to go to the sign and can not use the power before and must complete all the weaves before she leaves. When she has completed her task she will see the sign again directing her to where she must go.\nNynaeve steps in and finds herself on a beach next to a mountain with ash and smoke coming out. She hear people scream but she sees the sign and knows she must walk there. As she is doing it a large shower of stones falls towards her and she performs the first weave, a wall of air. She then turns to go help the people in the village but sees the sign on a hut. She walks trough the hut doorway and finds herself in a cavern. She walks out of the cavern and finds herself in the Waste. The heat is overwhelming but she walks over to some ruins and sees a rock in the formation of the sign. As she walks towards it she hears sounds and looks up to see Trollocs rushing towards her. She walks faster towards the rocks but does not run. She reaches the rocks and sends off a weave of fire completing the weave and sets it in place. She then sees an archway of stone with the six star sign on it and walks over and steps through.\nNynaeve finishes her forty-seventh weave which causes the sound of bells in the air. She is on top of a very narrow tower with wind blowing strongly. She sees an archway appear below her with the sign and jumps down through it. She finds herself naked and with cuts on her arms from being whipped. Her determinations kicks in and she gets up finds clothes and puts them on. She walks until she finds a six pointed star in the mud. Flies start to appear and flying around her and she starts to form a weave of air when she hears a scream. She starts to walk towards the sound but when she opens her mouth flies fly in. She remembers that she has to finish her weave and does forming a weave of air to push the flies back. She sees the sign above a door carved into a tree. Nynaeve walks down the hallway she found herself in. She finds a door and opens it to discover 4 children who are very sick. She decides to heal them but then remembers she can't. She then notices a room across the hall with a rug with the sign on it. She walks over leaving the children behind and completes the weave she is supposed to. She can hear the crying children but has to go on. She sees a door with the sign and walks to it.\nNynaeve's challenges get harder as she leaves people to drown, be beheaded, be buried alive, and she has to form a weave while giant spiders consume villagers. She stumbles through a doorway after completing her eightieth weave. She finds herself in the Two Rivers where people she knows are being attacked by shadowspawn bigger than Trollocs. Perrin calls for her to help but she sees the sign on a hillside and walks towards it but then then thinks that it's stupid and runs to the sign so she can channel, she decides she doesn't need to get to the star she needs to help her friends so she reaches for Saidar but finds something trying to block her but forces her way past it and uses Saidar to fling fire at the monsters. Attacking the monsters as she ran she reaches the star and forms the eighty-first weave which creates big fire rings she sends at the creatures. She then sees the sign on the roof of the inn and heads for it. She runs there feeling like a coward and goes through the door.\nNynaeve is on the last of the weaves she finds herself in a room. She finds an Accepted dress but leaves it thinking she's not Accepeted. She then finds a yellow dress and puts it on. She looks down upon broken rubble and lakes and realizes she is in Malkier. She sees the star below her feet and starts to form the last weave when she sees Lan being attacked by Darkhounds. She finishes the weave and sees a sign above the door of a shack. She starts to walk towards it but looks back at Lan who is fighting the Darkhounds. She decides to help him and starts throwing weaves of fire at them but the fire does nothing to them. She then draws a bunch of Saidar and made a weave of Balefire. She balefires a bunch of the Darkhounds and then balefires the ground in front of them causing the Darkhounds to fall in. She heads to the doorway with Lan and steps through and lands on the floor back in the Tower surrounded by the Aes Sedai. Rosil heals her. Saerin asks what happened saying she has never seen anyone put through what Nynaeve was put through. Barasine replies that it doesn't matter, that she failed. Lelaine agrees saying she did not show the calm of an Aes Sedai. Nynaeve tells them what she thought about it and walks over to Egwene. Egwene tells her she shouldn't have been able to channel but her time in the world of dreams and that the ter'angreal functions in the same way causing what's in your mind to be real. Egwene admits to being the one behind the Two Rivers scene and the Lan scene but Nynaeve says she is glad it showed her she would chose Lan over Aes Sedai and that without Lan she would never be herself. Saerin asks Nynaeve to swear to not use Balefire but she refuses saying she may need it when she fights at Shayol Ghul. Egwene points out to the rest that Nynaeve helped cleanse Saidin, defeated Moghedien, and is married to the king of Malkier. Yukiri, Seaine, Romanda, and Saerin vote that she passes and Rubinde, Barasine, and Lelaine vote no. With four yes' Nynaeve has passes the test. Rosil tells her she must pray and contemplate the burdens she will take upon receiving the shawl the next day. Nynaeve tells her she has something to do first.\nNynaeve makes a gateway and travels to the ouside of the Black Tower where she meets Myrelle. She tells Myrelle she passed the test and demands Lan's bond saying she is free of the oaths for one more day. Myrells passes the bond."

Alliandre agrees with Berelain that the trial is not a good idea and that they should either march away, or maybe attack the Whitecloaks. Faile explains that Perrin doesn't want anyone to believe that he has done something wrong. Berelain glances in the direction of the Whitecloak camp.

Elayne and Birgitte get looking glasses and with them Elayne can see the fifty dressing dummies that will be the dragon's targets. Birgitte is worried, she thinks that it would be better if Elayne watched it from below, because even if the prototype dragon won't be firing some men load it to show Elayne how it is done. Elayne ignores Birgitte and Aludra signals to the men on the other tower and one of them fires the dragon. The powerful sound makes Elayne jump, the ground trembles and a pocket on the mountainside explodes. The blast had missed the the dressing dummies though, but the men reload the dragon and changes its position slightly on Aludra's order and then they fires it off again and this time the blast hits dead-on and destroy a handful of them and knocks down a dozen. Elayne thinks that the dragons perhaps will be as deadly as damane and says to Aludra, when asked, that she finds it pleasing indeed and that Aludra will get the resources of all Andor but that she must keep the plans and designs a secret.

The troops reclaimed most of Maradon and are in the process of putting out the fires. Bashere is surprised with how well Ituralde defended the city giving him praise. Bashere tells Ituralde that Yoeli died. Ituralde thinks about how after all they did in the city it is lost. Bashere tells everyone to get ready to leave. Just then someone says something at the window and they go over to look to see Trollocs coming down the pass, many times the number that had been attacking them at Maradon. Bashere says they need to get ready to leave but Ituralde says if that force gets past there wont be any force in Saldea, Andor, or Arad Doman that can stop it. He then asks if Rand made peace with the Seanchan to which Rand walks in and tells him he has failed at that. Ituralde notices that Rand has changed that he is no longer looking suspicious and that he is looking at Ituralde with concern and he has wisdom in his eyes now. Rand apologizes to Ituralde and Bashere tells them they need to leave. Rand says no and that he will not allow the Trollocs to have the city. He then steps through a gateway with 2 maidens. Ituralde looks out his looking glass on to the field to see Rand being charged by thousands of Trollocs. Rand then starts destroying them using waves of fire.

Egwene attacks the group by blasting a wall down on them; she notices with some satisfaction that she has killed Evanellein. As she is assessing the damage she has done to the Blacks, Egwene is attacked from behind by Mesaana and sends herself away. Egwene evaluates her situation in relation to her environment, and taking Perrin\u2019s appearance as a lesson, comes to the conclusion that she must use her combination of skills, both those of a Dreamer and a channeller in order to win this battle.\nAs Egwene moves through the chaos of the battle she sees, much to her disappointment, Nicola. Almost instantly after Egwene sees her Nicola is killed. Melaine appears while Egwene is checking over Nicola\u2019s body and warns her of an attack, which she avoids. Two Black sisters, Alviarin and Ramola, are behind the attack. As she plans to retaliate them, Bair warns her that she is using a predictable pattern and she realises that this may well be an ambush with the two Blacks as bait. Shifting into the room behind the two Black sisters, Egwene prepares for Mesaana\u2019s attack. Mesaana appears, but Egwene is waiting for her and kills her with an Aiel spear. The corpse turns out to be Katerine, who appeared in Mesaana\u2019s disguised form.\nToo late Egwene realises that this attack was also a ruse and in the same instant she feels the snap of an a'dam fastening around her neck; Mesaana has captured her. Mesaana shifts herself and Egwene to a location without windows or doorway and Alviarin is waiting there for them. Mesaana in her triumph tells Alviarin to order the remaining Blacks upstairs to flee and await punishment for their pathetic performance in the battle.\nEgwene realises that in Tel'aran'rhiod an a\u2019dam has no power other than what she gives it and simply believes it off her neck as Mesaana attempts to question her about Perrin and the Dreamspike. On equal footing now the final showdown between Egwene and Mesaana becomes a challenge of wills. With Egwene calling on all of the strength of the Amyrlin Seat she is so strong that Mesaana\u2019s mind is destroyed utterly in the struggle.\nEgwene returns to the Tower of Tel'aran'rhiod and meets with Nynaeve, Siuan, Leane and the Wise One dreamwalkers. On seeing the state of Mesaana, Bair explains that she has seen this before and that it is caused by a dreamwalker encountering something that her mind could not affect. As the fleeing Black sisters can\u2019t get very far with the dome of the Dreamspike still over the city the Wise Ones decide to hunt them down.\nEgwene thanks the Wise Ones for their help and orders the Aes Sedai back to the Tower proper and just as she is waking she hears Bair lamenting that it was such a shame that Egwene went to the White Tower rather than return to the Wise Ones."

As Slayer notices the missing ter\u2019angreal in Perrin\u2019s hand, Perrin strikes with a knife he has just thought into being in his other hand.\nRemembering Hopper\u2019s words of how nightmares are very strong, Perrin throws the Dream Spike into the nearby flow of lava, taking this moment of respite to destroy the ter\u2019angreal once and for all.\nHopper sends to Perrin that he should flee now and that to complete his answers he should find Boundless and with that Hopper dies in the Wolf Dream."

Androl weaves a tiny Gateway an inch across that he uses to cut the leather, remembering that Logain had told him he raised him for his skills with Gateways. He finished the armguard he was making.

There were dozens of them now all talking about making bargains but Mat refuses to make a bargain until they get to the Chamber of Bonds. Mat swings at one but his weapon goes through it. Thom throws a knife at one and it hits. Mat swings at another one but using the iron side this time and slices open one of them. The Finns start appearing on both sides of them. One group distracting trying to give the group on the other side a chance to attack. Thom throws knives at them but Mat tells him to stop telling him they are trying to get them to waste the knives. Mat lights a nightflower and throws it. As it goes off it blinds the Finns and Mat turns around with his eyes closed, opens them and heads down the corridor in front of him. They continue straight and end up in a room that is star-shaped with eight tips and only one doorway with eight empty pedestals, one at each point and Moiraine is floating in the middle. Mat reaches into the mist that is holding Moiraine and pulls back quickly because it is hot. Thom reaches in and Mat warns him but he doesn't care. Thom pulls her out and wraps her in his cloak. He takes off a bracelet she is wearing saying it looks like a ter'angreal but an Eelfinn responds saying it's an angreal almost strong enough to be a sa'angreal and that it can be part of her price if they wish to pay it. There are now four male and four female Eelfinn on the pedestals. As part of the bargain Mat demands the way out restored back where it was and open again and that they have to leave the way out open until they get through. No blocking it up or making it vanish when they arrive. With the way direct, with no changing rooms about. A straight pathway and the Eelfinns can't knock them unconscious or try to kill them or anything like that and that they get to take Moiraine. They ask him what price he will pay. He tells them he will give them half the light of the world. They jump from their pedestals and rush him. When Thom and Noal move towards them he tells them to stop that it must be done or they will kill them. One of the Finns sticks its claws in Mats eye socket and rip his eye right out.

The first inn he tries has Deathwatch Guards, but the second, the Yearly Brawl is acceptable.\nInside the inn, a man, Jame questions him, but is ushered away by Kathana, who asks Mat how he lost the eye and doesn't believe the lie he tells, though she claims he lies well. She tells him that duels are now regulated, which she feels has taken the fun out of them, but Jame, who is not Ebou Dari, feels it has saved lives. Jame mistakes Mat for an assassin, as he thinks that no real one eyed man would carry so many throwing knives and Mat shows him the hole where his eye used to be, asking him if there are assassins after Tuon. Jame tells him there are and that he has personally seen to it that one died in the dueling grounds. Mat asks who is bringing them, and eventually Jame tells him it is Lunal Galgan. They talk a little more and Kathana realises who Mat is and that every soldier in Ebou Dar has been told to look for his face."

They have been fighting for a week at their current spot in a Kandori field. With a sword and a shield Gawyn has positioned himself in front of Egwene's horse. Gawyn fights a few oncoming Trollocs while the Aes Sedai use the One Power to rip them apart. The Aes Sedai have been fighting on a rotating basis through the grueling fight and as the next pair arrives Egwene and Silviana exit the battlefield. Gawyn knows that he is needed, but still feels as if he is being wasted. He and Egwene step into the command tent to greet Gareth Bryne and Siuan. They discuss troop movements and the importance of the Aes Sedai in the battle. After discussing Taim and the Dreadlords the pair leave so that Egwene can get some sleep. Leilwin and Bayle Domon are waiting outside the tent. Leilwin expresses annoyance that Egwene doesn't trust her and she tells Gawyn that she will serve him if she cannot serve Egwene. Leilwin and Domon leave to bring Gawyn food as he settles to the ground and contemplates the black rings he stole from the Seanchan assassins. He asks Leilwin about them as she returns with his food. She reacts with a hiss and tells them that the Empress gives them to Bloodknives. The rings are dangerous and with one touch of blood the ring will become activated which will become deadly. He pockets the rings and tells himself that the way of a Warder is to protect her on the battlefield and not to ride out like some hero. He decides not to tell Egwene about the rings."

Fortuona asks Mat why he didn't tell her that Egwene had been collared once, because it changes the grounds of the argument. Egwene is baffled to hear they are married.\nEgwene reminds her that Rand promised the Seanchan would help. In accordance with the Dragon's Peace, Fortuona also acknowledges the nation borders as they are currently mapped and will take no marath'damane except in the lands they control, namely Altara, Amadicia, Tarabon, and Almoth Plain. Since Tremalking is mapped as Sea Folk country, Egwene presses Fortuona to release it and the other Sea Folk isles.\nBefore giving her definite assent to help, Fortuona wants Egwene to decree that any channeler in her lands who wishes to be collared must be allowed to come to Ebou Dar. Egwene reluctantly agrees, but insists that any woman who wants to go free should also be allowed to do so.\nAnother argument ensues in which Egwene says the a'dam works just as well on sul'dam, because they can learn to channel and dares Fortuona to put on the collar herself, because she once trained damane as well.\nMat goes between them and reminds them their armies need them level-headed. Fortuona promises to help and will send some sul'dam and damane to reinforce the Aes Sedai at the ford. Before leaving, Egwene whispers to Mat that she will find a way to free him, but he says he can manage."

Their plan is indeed working: the Trollocs are completely surrounded and being slaughtered.\nThen they notice a second Trolloc army approaching from behind, although Bashere hadn't expected it before the next day. Elayne gives out orders and rides back to tell Bashere. She finds him arguing with Tam. Bashere suggests retreat, but Talmanes says they would sustain heavy losses if they did that.\nTam believes it was all planned out, because none of the armies had been watching their rear, thinking someone else did it, because Bashere had showed them scout reports. Elayne concludes he must be a Darkfriend, relieves him of duty and has Talmanes place him and his wife under guard.\nShe gives out orders to prepare for the second army and readies herself to fight."

He thinks it should give him an unsurmountable advantage, but the gateways that look down on the battle even things out. He considers Traveling to the command post at Dashar Knob but is concerned it might be a trap. He wonders why the resistance encountered when diverting the river was a small unit of soldiers and townspeople. He looks to his side and sees Shendla, with three other women and thinks that his affection for her is almost enough to change his heart. Galbrait, the leader of the Ayyad tells him she failed and that Mat escaped, but he says she wasn't supposed to kill him because he is beyond her skill. It is enough that she disrupted his command post. Demandred still suspects that Mat is Lews Therin in disguise, but feels he can't prove it. He thinks that to truly master battle tactics takes centuries. He admits to himself that in general, Lews Therin was more accomplished than he was, but that Demandred was the better general. He thinks that if Cauthon really is Lews Therin, he is a better general than he was in the Age of Legends. He wonders when Mat will commit the damane and if he can widen the fracture between them and the Aes Sedai. The three Ayyad leave and he asks Shendla if she is worried, fighting alongside Trollocs and Halfmen despite not having given herself to the Shadow. She tells him she doesn't see his actions as evil, as he will remake the world and preserve her people. He briefly wonders what he will do once Lews Therin is dead and the world has been remade. Taim arives, through a True Power gateway. He mocks Demandred for losing the battle near the ruins and Demandred has two dozen of his Ayyad shield him but Taim seizes the True Power and fights back. Demandred shields him with a True Power shield and pulls energy out of him and the intense use of the True Power begins to unravel the Pattern. He tells Taim to keep away from him, from Lews Therin, and from the enemy general, but other than that he doesn't care what chaos he creates . He turns and weaves balefire from the True Power, destroying hundreds of the forces of the Light. He tells Taim to go and is amazed that he is able to Travel with the True Power."

Taim thinks him insane, far worse than when they first met. As he leaves, Demandred tells him that Sakarnen is bonded to him and if Taim tries to use it against him it will destroy Taim. He tells Taim to use balefire against the Amyrlin."
