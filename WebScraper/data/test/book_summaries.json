Bukama, his friend and teacher, soon joins him, and the two of them speak about the Aiel War that they are participating in.\nAs they walk, one of the sentries leads a nameless Tairen officer to them. The officer is there on behalf of one Lord Emares, who wishes to form an anvil and hammer to attack a group of five or six hundred Aiel. Lan agrees and sends Bukama off to awaken the men.\nThey set off, and soon they reach the Hook, a treeless crest that is less than forty feet high and a mile long that doubles back from the north to the south. It is here that Lan and his men will form the anvil. Lan finds himself hoping that the Aiel do not simply choose a spot and use their bows, since in this way he will lose a lot of men.\nWhen the Aiel appear, Lan sees that there are easily two thousand of them. Lan decides to stay where he is, because if Emares strikes without the anvil in place, the Tairens will be crushed. However, if Emares does not show up by the time the Aiel are within two hundred paces of Lan's men, he will get his men to try to ride around the Aiel warriors to join Emares.\nAt five hundred paces, the Aiel come to a stop. Raising their spears, they shout \"Aan'allein!\" which means \"One Man Alone\" in the Old Tongue. Lan and his men are all confused, even more so when the Aiel warriors veer to the east, not attacking them. Lan decides not to follow, but instead wishes to speak with Emares."

As Moiraine waits in the cold office, she thinks about the Aiel War, about the two Aes Sedai in the room, about why they seemed to be worried, and about her closest friend, Siuan. As she thinks specifically about how Gitara has the Talent of Foretelling, she wishes that she could be present during one of Gitara's Foretellings.\nSuddenly, outside, trumpets begin to blare. Tamra sends Moiraine to see if there is a message from the battlefield, and tells Siuan to make some tea. Moiraine exits the room into the anteroom, and speaks to Elin Warrel, the novice on duty. There have been no messages. When Moiraine returns, she joins Siuan where the other girl is preparing the tea, and takes a cup to Gitara. When Tamra sees her, she asks if there is any news. Before Moiraine can reply, Gitara jumps to her feet, her eyes wide with terror.\n\"He is born again!\" she says. \"I feel him! The Dragon takes his first breath on the slope of Dragonmount! He is coming! He is coming! Light help us! Light help the world! He lies in the snow and cries like the thunder! He burns like the sun!\" As she finishes speaking, Gitara falls forward into Moiraine's arms. Tamra is there in an instant, using the One Power to Delve and find out what is wrong with Gitara; she is dead.\nTamra orders horrified Moiraine and Siuan not to tell anyone that Gitara has just Foretold the birth of the Dragon Reborn, though she does not mention the word \"Dragon\". She then orders for Elin to be sent in to her, so that Tamra can tell her where to find Gitara's serving woman.\nAs Moiraine and Siuan leave the room, Moiraine thinks to herself, \"I wished to hear a Foretelling, and what I received was a Foretelling of doom.\""

They decide to skip breakfast as they both feel as if they couldn't eat a thing and head towards the Accepted quarters. In Siuan's room, they begin to practice for the Aes Sedai test, with Siuan attempting to make Moiraine lose her concentration. After a little while, Myrelle enters the room and joins in their practicing. Together, Siuan and Myrelle do a good job of distracting Moiraine.\nTarna Feir, another Accepted, arrives and tells the three other girls that the Amyrlin Seat has summoned the Accepted to the Oval Lecture Hall, and also tells them that Gitara died.\nWhen the four of them reach the Lecture Hall, all of the other Accepted are already there, all of them gossiping about why Tamra wishes to speak to them. One girl thinks that they are all to be tested immediately for the shawl, while another thinks that Gitara had a Foretelling about the end of the White Tower, so they are all going to be sent home.\nWhen Tamra enters the room, she puts all of these rumors to rest. She announces to them all that, in thanksgiving for the continued safety of Tar Valon, the Tower will be awarding each woman in the city and surrounding area who has recently had a child with one hundred crowns. As there are no available Aes Sedai around, she is sending them into the camps nearest to the city to record information on each child that has been born. Each Accepted will be accompanied by four guards. She warns them to be careful, as there are Whitecloaks with the army.\nAs the Accepted leave, Moiraine and Siuan are both very excited. They know that Tamra wishes to find the Dragon Reborn."

When Moiraine is done, she joins Siuan, and they hurry towards the West Stable. Once they mount their horses, eight guards led by a man named Steler are assigned to accompany the two of them.\nThey begin to make their way through the city, seeing people from every country as they go. The city is alive and very noisy, as if there hadn't been a battle outside the walls. Moiraine even sees some Ogier stonemasons repairing buildings.\nFinally, they reach the Alindaer Gate and proceed to exit the city. As they begin to ride across the bridge, they see a group of nine or ten Whitecloaks at the foot of the bridge. They sit for a moment, and then turn and ride away.\nOnce off the bridge, Siuan attempts to make Steler take them to the farthest camps, the ones that just happen to be the nearest to Dragonmount, but he refuses. They ride past a camp where one Accepted, Sarene, is already taking names, but stop at the next one. Once Steler announces their purpose, a table, two stools and two braziers are set up."

At first, women seethe around them in a very disorderly manner, until Siuan weaves Air and Fire to enhance her voice and orders them to be quiet. There are women from all stations in life, from noblewomen to farmers' wives. One of the women, Susa Wynn, has a child that is too old to have been born recently, but Moiraine writes her name down anyway. Susa is very thin and most likely starving, and her child is sick. Feeling sympathy for the woman, Moiraine gives her money so that she can take her son to a Wise Woman.\nSome time later, once noon has passed and Moiraine and Siuan have eaten, two Aes Sedai, Meilyn and Elaida, show up, effectively ruining the camp's belief that Moiraine and Siuan are Aes Sedai. Meilyn reminds them to be back at the Tower before dark, and then she and Elaida leave.\nThe women waiting in line are now not nearly as respectful as they had been earlier, and several times Moiraine and Siuan have to shout and threaten. When they get down to about a dozen women, Steler tells them that it is time to leave. Women from the camp hold him and the other guards back while Moiraine and Siuan quickly finish.\nThey manage to get back to the Tower before sunset. In the Accepted's quarters, Katerine Alruddin, another Accepted, is waiting for them, and tells Moiraine that Merean, the Mistress of Novices, wishes to see her. When Moiraine arrives at Merean's study, she is told that three of her uncles, King Laman and two of his brothers, were killed that day. Merean also says that because of this, Moiraine does not have to go out the next day. Moiraine argues that if she stays behind, she will be alone, but Merean is still doubtful. Upon returning to her room, Moiraine skips supper and instead prays for her uncles' souls.\nThat night, she has nightmares about the Dragon Reborn. She ends up spending the rest of the night in Siuan's room."

So that her mind isn't left unoccupied, she will be put to work copying out the messier lists of names. When Siuan agrees that Moiraine should stay behind, Merean tells her that she can keep Moiraine company. Siuan tells Moiraine that this way they get to look at all of the lists, and that maybe they can find the Dragon Reborn. The two of them eat breakfast and then get to work. Moiraine is worried since a lot of the information is very vague, such as \"born within sight of Tar Valon's walls.\"\nThe next morning, Moiraine and Siuan continue their work, though no one said that they had to. Shortly after, two clerks walk in, and the elder remarks that she dislikes \"being set a task only to learn someone else is already performing it.\" They leave, and minutes later, Tamra appears. She tells them that they may continue if they wish.\nAbout an hour later, Moiraine comes across a likely entry, and writes it down on a separate piece of paper for later use. Siuan is also writing likely names down in a small book.\nShortly after midmorning, one of the Gray Sitters, Jarna Malari, appears and tells Moiraine to come walk with her. Jarna questions Moiraine about who she thinks will become the next king or queen of Cairhien.\nThroughout the day, six more Sitters, one from each Ajah, each speak with Moiraine. Tsutama, one of the Red Sitters, asks outright if Moiraine has ever thought of being queen of Cairhien herself. This just gives Moiraine more nightmares.\nWhereas before, Moiraine had not thought herself ready to be tested for Aes Sedai, she now wants to be tested as soon as possible. She decides that she will leave the Tower as soon as she is raised to Aes Sedai, until the whole Cairhien issue has blown over."

Waiting in the room are the three Sitters of every Ajah, as well as two other sisters from every Ajah, each with a shawl over her arm in case Moiraine or Siuan choose their Ajah.\nAfter a bit of ritual talk (stating names and reasons for being there, etc.), first Moiraine and then Siuan swear the Three Oaths. Once that is done, both of them choose the Blue Ajah and receive their shawls. All of the Blue Sisters in the room welcome them. Eadyth, one of the Sitters, charges Leane Sharif and Rafela Cindal, the two non-Sitter Blues, with the task of escorting Moiraine and Siuan to the Blue quarters. When they arrive, they find every Blue sister currently in Tar Valon wrapped in their shawls and lining the main corridor."

The order said to lay open Moiraine's finances to him. Luckily for Moiraine, Mistress Dormaile, the banker, had him imprisoned, although he later escaped.\nWanting to be prepared, Moiraine begins to lay down plans, not to run away, but to be ready.\nLater, Moiraine and Siuan visit a dressmaker named Tamore Alkohima. Moiraine ends up ordering twenty dresses, though Siuan only gets six. Siuan complains about the price, and Moiraine can tell that Tamore is displeased; she knows that Tamore will find a way to get back at Siuan for it (and at Moiraine for keeping her waiting while she spoke to Siuan about it), most likely by making the gowns very snug and revealing, as well as in a very light color, at least for Moiraine. Moiraine also orders four dark, Cairhienin-style riding dresses.\nMoiraine is quite pleased with the day, however. She thinks that the number of dresses she has ordered will make the Hall think that she plans on staying at the Tower for a long while. Moiraine thinks to herself that, for the moment, she is as ready as she can be."

This includes things such as the Warder Bond, the trick for ignoring heat and cold, and Ajah secrets. At the same time, Siuan is still working for Cetalia Delarme, something about which she complains a lot.\nAbout a week after Moiraine and Siuan are raised to Aes Sedai, Ellid is summoned for her test, but does not return from the ter'angreal. Another week later, Sheriam is summoned, passes, and chooses the Blue Ajah.\nA few days later, it is announced that Tamra has died in her sleep. Moiraine thinks that perhaps the new Amyrlin Seat will free her from the job of handing out the bounty, and then is immediately disgusted that that is all she can think about. As a penance, she forces herself to wear the lightest color of dress that Tamore sends to her, a blue so pale that it is nearly white. It is also snugly cut, and earns Moiraine stares from many of the other Sisters. At Tamra's funeral, many of the Aes Sedai, including Moiraine, speak.\nThe evening after Tamra's funeral, Sierin Vayu of the Gray Ajah is raised to the Amyrlin Seat. She is a very strict woman, but she does let Moiraine off from the bounty job. However, she also commands that Moiraine stay in Tar Valon.\nNevertheless, Moiraine still plans to leave. She says goodbye to Siuan and then heads out into the city. First, she visits Mistress Dormaile, her banker, where she takes out two hundred gold and silver crowns, as well as several letters-of-rights. Her next stop is at Tamore's dress shop, where she picks up her Cairhienin-style riding dresses. She hires porters and buys everything that she needs before buying passage on a ship named Bluewing. As the ship pulls out of harbor, she catches sight of a tall man staring after her. He fits Mistress Dormaile's description of the Cairhienin man who tried to get access to Moiraine's finances.\nAs the ship continues to sail away, Moiraine thinks about how she has now passed into disobedience to the Amyrlin Seat."

They go to a table and sit down. A serving maid named Lira brings them wine, and gives Lan an invitation to spend the night with her.\nLan and Ryne talk about a few things, including the fact that a woman named Edeyn Arrel, who was Lan's first lover, has raised the Golden Crane (Malkier's flag) in Lan's name. There are several hundred men in Canluum alone ready to follow her and Lan. With a lot to think about, Lan goes out to the stable and paces for a while, thinking about Edeyn and Malkier as he does so. Eventually, he sits down and assumes the ko'di, calming himself.\nBukama shows up and tells Lan that he has heard about the Golden Crane and Edeyn. When they leave the stable, there are six men walking towards them. Lan knows even before they draw their swords that they are going to attack him and Bukama. Since Bukama not only doesn't have his sword with him but has sworn an oath to keep the peace, Lan orders him back into the stable, and Bukama obeys. Lan then goes to meet the six attackers.\nLan assumes the ko'di once again, they begin to fight. He relieves one man of his left eye, and receives a gash across his ribs from another man. Lan slices off another man's left arm, and is rewarded with a nick near his own eye from the same man who cut him before. Lan knows that the only reasonable outcome will be for him to die, but he fights anyway; his duty is to Bukama, who is not able to fight for himself while in Canluum. He kicks in the head of the man who has wounded him, and continues to fight the men while suffering injuries himself.\nWhen Lan finally stops, he realizes that all of the six attackers are now dead. People begin to flood out of the inn, demanding to know what has happened. Lira and Bukama both run to Lan, checking on his injuries. Racelle Arovni sends a woman for the Watch.\nRyne also goes to Lan, and remarks that two of the attackers had been men who had listened to Edeyn. For this reason, he thinks that perhaps Edeyn was behind the attack. She has raised the Golden Crane in Lan's name, but with Lan dead, she could be Queen of Malkier. Lan is angry with Ryne for saying this, not because he doesn't believe Edeyn capable of it, but because there are strangers around.\nBukama asks Lan where they will be going now, and Lan replies that they will go to Chachin.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

The only thing she can think of is that Siuan has let something slip to Sierin, and that it would be just like the Amyrlin to send Siuan after her so that they can worry about their punishment together on the long ride back to the White Tower.\nWhen they finally meet in an alley, Siuan says, \"Light, I thought I'd never bloody find you. Tell me you've found him, Moiraine. Tell me the Najima boy's the one, and we can hand him to the Tower with a hundred sisters watching, and it's done.\"\nWhen Moiraine inquires as to what's wrong, Siuan tells her what has happened. All of Tamra's searchers are dead. Aisha, Kerene, Valera, Ludice and Meilyn. The story is that Aisha and her Warder were killed by bandits in Murandy, and that Kerene had fallen off a ship during a storm on the Alguenya. Siuan then tells Moiraine that she had gone to speak to Meilyn after hearing about all of the others. She had waited in Meilyn's room, underneath the bed so that no one would see her. Meilyn never came. The next morning, it was announced that Meilyn had died in her sleep.

Moiraine quickly weaves shields of Air in front of Lan and herself, and then wraps the assassin in flows of Air; she had just meant to keep him from shooting again, but Bukama and Ryne use this chance to loose arrows of their own.

Caniedrin dies after telling them that he had been paid to kill them. \"Gold. Why else? You still have the Dark One's luck turning just then or that shaft would have found your heart.

On the way, she sees Bukama and Ryne practice fighting in a courtyard, and thinks that now she will have to avoid them and Lan.\nShe meets and spends some time talking with Brys and members of his family. She learns here that Lan is actually the king of lost Malkier, and is shocked. She pretends that she is unwell and is led back to her rooms by a serving girl named Elis. On the way, she runs across Merean, who has just arrived at the palace. She and Merean exchange a few words, and Elis realizes that Moiraine is also Aes Sedai. Moiraine commands Elis to take her to Lan's apartments, and Elis obeys.\nOnce in Lan's apartments, Moiraine announces that she wants him to do something for her. \"There was a pledge made, and held since the War of the Hundred Years, that Malkier would ride when the White Tower called. I am Aes Sedai, and I call you!\"\nLan replies that he will help her if she answers a question for him. His question is this: \"When Malkier died, Shienar and Arafel sent men. They could not stop the flood of Trollocs and Myrddraal, yet they came. Men rode from Kandor, and even Saldaea. They came too late, but they came. For nine hundred years we rode when the White Tower called, but where was the Tower when Malkier died? If you are Aes Sedai, answer me that!\"\nAs it happens, the answer to that question is Sealed to the Tower, but Moiraine tells him the truth anyway. Over a hundred sisters were sent to Malkier, but they arrived too late. The White Tower felt that it was better for their reputation for others to think that the Tower had done nothing than to have it known that Aes Sedai had tried and failed.\nLan accepts the answer and asks Moiraine what she wants. She wants him to have someone watch Merean, to note where she goes, what she does, and who she meets. They agree that Bukama will watch Merean, and that he will report to Moiraine's maid, Suki (Siuan).\nWhen Moiraine returns to her rooms, it is to find that Iselle Arrel is waiting for her. She demands that she be taken to the Tower since she has the ability to channel, but Moiraine tells her to go by herself if she wishes, and has Siuan show her out. When Moiraine tells Siuan that Bukama will be watching Merean, Siuan is upset that Moiraine has taken such a risk. Siuan tells Moiraine that an old man (Bukama) approached her that day, asked if she was Suki, and then let her know that Merean spent most of the day with Brys.\nSiuan then tells Moiraine what she has learned from Cal. Ines Demain's son, Rahien, was born the day after Gitara's Foretelling, making it even more likely that he is the Dragon Reborn. Siuan also informs Moiraine that she will be moving in with Ines Demain's servants. She has led Cal to believe that she has been dismissed from Moiraine's service for spilling wine on her, and Cal thinks that he can get her a job working for Ines.\n<< Previous Chapter | Next Chapter >>"

That leaves only Moiraine.\nMoiraine is now convinced that Merean is of the Black Ajah, and tells Lan that if he cares at all for Iselle he will keep her away from Merean. Lan replies that all Aes Sedai are dangerous; besides, he just saw Iselle hurrying by with Brys and Diryk.\nMoiraine's mind is racing now, thinking of Merean with Iselle, and Iselle with Brys and Diryk. Suddenly, she asks Lan where Brys would go for privacy, and tells him to take her there.\nTogether, Moiraine and Lan hurry to Brys' private balcony. When they get there, Iselle is speaking to Merean, and Brys and Diryk are standing by the rail of the balcony, wrapped in flows of Air. Moiraine lashes out at Merean with a shield of Spirit, but the shield splinters.\nRyne is also there, and Moiraine now knows that he is a Darkfriend. Merean tells Ryne that he did a good job of killing the spy (Bukama), and tells him to take care of Lan. Merean then wraps Iselle up in flows of Air and turns to take care of Moiraine, attacking with her own shield of Spirit.\nAs Lan and Ryne begin to fight, Moiraine and Merean are engaged in their own battle with the One Power, each trying to shield the other; at the same time, Moiraine is trying to free Brys, Diryk and Iselle. As they battle, Merean speaks to Moiraine about how if she wounds her, she will Heal her so that she can question her.\nAfter a little while, Merean says, \"This is taking too long, don't you think, child?\" With that, she lifts Diryk into the air and drifts him over the railing. Moiraine screams as Diryk falls to his death, and white light explodes in Moiraine's head.\nWhen Moiraine opens her eyes, a couple of minutes have passed. She feels very groggy and is shielded by Merean. Lan and Ryne are still fighting, and Brys is staring in hatred at his son's murderess, Merean.\nBrys is the next to go over the railing. Moiraine struggles to her feet with determination. As Merean lifts Iselle into the air, Moiraine lunges towards Merean and stabs her in the back with her belt knife. In shock, Merean lets the shield on Moiraine drop, and Moiraine scrambles towards Iselle, who is teetering atop the stone railing, screaming. As Iselle slips and starts to fall, Moiraine grabs her hand, but cannot pull her up. She is also unable to grasp the Source, but she is determined to save at least one person.\nHowever, Iselle's hand slips from her grasp. As Moiraine watches Iselle fall, Lan pulls her away. \"Never watch a death you don't have to,\" he tells her. He is wounded, but alive.\nOnce Moiraine is able to walk again, she goes over to Merean and sees Ryne lying on the ground dead. Once she is able to embrace the Source, she Heals Lan. She then burns Merean's body, telling Lan that there is no proof that she was Black Ajah, only that she was Aes Sedai.\n\"You are a very hard woman,\" Lan tells her. Moiraine replies, \"I am as hard as I must be.\"\n<< Previous Chapter / Next Chapter >>"

She tells Siuan how Diryk was the one that Merean wanted to kill the most; it was Diryk that she told Iselle to bring to her, and Diryk that she killed first. Merean also tried to kill Lan. Lan is said to be the luckiest man in the world; Diryk recently survived a fall that should have killed him.

                            "pov_summary": "Lews Therin Telamon wanders through a palace filled with dead bodies lying everywhere. The palace is smeared in soot and has scorch-marks on the walls, floors and ceiling as a result of the lighting and fires, which killed many. It had once been pretty, with bright murals, colorful tapestries and paintings and finely carved furnishing inlaid with ivory and gold.\nLews Therin calls for his wife, Ilyena without noticing the dead people on the floor. He's wearing what was once a fine cloak, on which is embroidered a circle half white and half black, the colors separated by a sinuous line. When he sees it in a mirror, he remembers that it meant something, but he can't remember what.\nThe air behind him ripples and shimmers, solidifying a black-clad man who calls Lews Therin 'Lord of the Morning' and says that he has come for him.\nLews Therin asks if he has the Voice, as it will soon be time for the Singing. He then calls for Ilyena to meet the guest, something that makes the man wonder if \"the taint already has you so far in its grip\".\nThe man tries to make him remember more, when Lews Therin recognizes the name Shai'tan as a dangerous one that is better left unspoken, but the man says that it isn't dangerous for him.\nWhen Lews Therin asks him who he is and what he wants, he presents himself as Elan Morin Tedronai, the Betrayer of Hope. That's what men named him just as Lews Therin was named the Dragon, but from now on people would call Lews Therin Kinslayer.\nAs Lews Therin again calls down the ruined hall for Ilyena, Elan Morin says that Lews Therin once stood first among the Servants, wore the ring of Tamyrlin, sat in the High Seat, summoned the Nine Rods of Dominion and once defeated him at the Gates of Paaran Disen. He then says that that he himself was never very skilled at Healing and that he follows a different power now. He then Heals Lews Therin, who screams of the pain while he staggers around. After some time the pain recedes, and he recognizes Ilyena, a golden-haired woman lying among the dead on the floor.\nElan Morin tries to make him serve the Great Lord of the Dark and says that he can make Ilyena live again. Lews Therin says that he will destroy Elan Morin for Ilyena's death, but he responds by reminding him on his futile attack made by him and his Hundred Companions, who tear the world apart as they talk, on the Great Lord.\nLews Therin looks around and sees faces he loved all slain by him. He then reaches out for the tainted saidin and Travels to a flat and empty landscape where he draws deeply of the Source as he remembers how he had believed in his pride, and while he shouts for forgiveness, a bolt of lightning and fire strikes from the heaven and through Lews Therin, making the earth heave while molten rock fountains high up in the air. When the earth's trembling has finished, Lews Therin is gone and where he stood is now a tall mountain.\nElan Morin appears at the mountain where he promises that it won't end that easily for the Dragon."

                            "pov_summary": "A nine year old Egwene al'Vere is filling her bucket with water from the Winespring. Today is the day the sheep are sheared on a field just outside Emond's Field. Her job is to carry water to the men and women at work and she takes it very seriously. While filling the bucket she notices a raven nearby. The raven behaves strangely; it seems to be watching the men. Could this raven be the Dark One's eyes?\nKenley Ahan, a boy two years her senior, tells her she can't play with the children this year. Kenley will be allowed to help the older boys next year and he seems to think that gives him some kind of authority. Egwene gives him the level look she's seen the older girls and women use on the boys and men, but it doesn't seem to work very well. Egwene decides that she needs to work on that.\nMaking her way through the crowd she hands out water to anyone who asks for it. There are only five days a year when so many people gather in Emond's Field. At Shearing, the day the merchants come to buy wool, the day the merchants come to buy tabac, Sunday and Foolday. Egwene tries to avoid her four sisters in the crowd. They all seem to think she is a baby and usually treat her accordingly. She also tries to keep away from the big sheepdogs. Not that they would harm her but she doesn't really care for them anyway.\nOn her way back to refill her bucket, she passes the row of trestle tables. She spots Kenley again trying to steal a honey cake from one of the tables. He doesn't get far though, Corin Ayellin catches him quickly. Whatever authority he thought he had over Egwene is now gone.\nAs she moves away from the tables she spots the village smith Master Luhhan talking to Joslyn and Con Aybara. Their son Perrin is with them, looking shy and blushing. She doesn't quite understand what they were discussing but it involved Perrin. She notices she is not the only one watching Perrin. Cilia Cole, a girl a few years older than Egwene is looking at him too. Egwene grimaces at the sight of Cilia making big eyes at Perrin. Then she spots the raven behind Cilia. And it is not the only one, they seem to be everywhere today...\nPerrin's sister Adora asks her why she is staring at Perrin. Egwene is startled by her and she doesn't like the way Adora suggests that she was looking at Perrin in that way. She makes a nasty comment and looks for Perrin again to follow him. Unfortunately he's gone. There is nothing to it but go back to the river to refill her bucket.\nWhen she has refilled the bucket she comes across Mistress Barran, the village Wisdom, with her apprentice, the recently orphaned Nynaeve al'Meara. They are tending a wound Bili Congar inflicted on himself with a pair of wool shears. Behind them Egwene sees dozens and dozens of ravens. None of them are trying to take any food, they are just watching. It looks unnatural to Egwene. Before she can ask the Wisdom about it though, Nynaeve asks her if she doesn't have work to do. Nynaeve is with her back to Egwene, yet she always seems to know when she is there. The only thing she can do is get back to work. Her day doesn't get any better when she overhears her sister Elisa and some other women talking about why her hair isn't braided yet. Elisa takes her frustration out on Egwene.\nAfter she has refilled the bucket again she starts looking for Perrin or Mat. It takes her a while to find the boys. When she finds them, Egwene sneaks up to overhear their conversation. Mat and Perrin are in the company of a few other boys, Rand al'Thor among them. Rand is the boy everybody says she will marry later. Egwene wonders if he will make a good husband, and what, for that matter, a good husband is.\nThe boys talk about their future; most of them expect to follow in their father's footsteps. A few of them dream of seeing something of the world first though. Egwene vows that she will see some of the lands Jain Farstrider describes in her favourite book. Not a lot of people leave the Two Rivers but she would. The boys get ready to get back to work again so it is time for Egwene to leave. When she is about to leave Dannil Lewin passes her hiding place and tells the boys the Mayor wants them. She decides to follow them to see why her father wants to talk to them.\nThe Mayor tells the boys they have worked hard today and that he will reward them with a story. Of course the boys want a story about Trollocs and false Dragons. Bran al'Vere doesn't know any stories about that so he asks Tam al'Thor to do the story telling. Tam decides to tell them the story about how the real Dragon led the Hundred Companions to Shayol Ghul to sealed the bore into the Dark One's prison. Cenn Buie, the thatcher, says that isn't a story decent folk should listen to but all the other men seem to approve so Tam tells it anyway. When Tam is done telling Perrin wants to know what a dragon is in the first place. Tam doesn't know the answer to that.\nThe boys get sent back to work after Tam is done telling his tale. Egwene gets ready to follow them but she suddenly becomes aware of someone watching her. Again she notices the ravens. This time they are not only looking at the boys and men. One of them is looking at her. Determined not to be distracted by silly thoughts Egwene gets on with trying to be the best water carrier ever.\nEgwene had to carry water again next year to her disappointment but the year after she got to help with the food. She set herself a new goal then. To be the youngest girl to get her hair braided ever. It wouldn't be easy but easy goals are not really goals at all. She didn't listen to any more stories though, but she still liked to read of distant lands."

Even though spring should have arrived, the wind is still carrying an icy chill sending gusts of cold through Rand. He is holding a bow and arrow, ready to draw quickly. The winter has been bad, with wolves and bears hunting in the Two Rivers. Tam and Rand are transporting apple brandy and apple cider to the Winespring Inn for use during Bel Tine. As they walk, Rand gets a feeling that he's being watched and tries to shrug it off. But as the feeling grows stronger, he looks over his shoulder, and sees a black-clad, cloaked figure on a black horse.\nThe rider is totally covered in his cloak so that no part of him is showing. When he looks at him, Rand feels that the rider hates everything that's alive, but him above all things. He stumbles, and Tam asks him what's wrong, but when they look down the road again, it is empty. Tam reminds him of the flame and the void, a thing he has taught Rand. He should concentrate on one flame and feed all of his passions in it until his mind became empty, and focus on the void.\nThey finally arrive in Emond's Field, where things are being done ready for Bel Tine. Wit Congar stops them and asks Tam what to do with the village's Wisdom, Nynaeve al'Meara. The Congars and Coplins are well known for being complainers and troublemakers. He is stopped by his wife, Daise Congar, who tells him not to meddle in Women's Circle business. As they continue, they walk past the Green, where older women are erecting the Spring Pole. When they reach the Winespring Inn, Bran al'Vere, innkeeper and the Mayor, greets them. Cenn Buie appears and the three men start talking about the Wisdom.\nMat Cauthon hides behind the cart so only Rand can see him, and they start talking. Mat mentions that he and a friend caught a badger and plan to set it loose to wreak havoc at the upcoming festivities. Rand finds out that Mat also has seen the stranger on the horse and while they discuss him, Tam spots Mat and gets him to help Rand with unloading the cider. He tells them that a gleeman has arrived in the village to entertain at Bel Tine, something that cheers the boys up after talking about the rider."

She's like no one Rand has ever seen before, with her hair unbraided and wearing strange clothes. They introduce themselves, and she gives them a coin each. She implies that she has come to the Two Rivers to collect old stories. When they ask what kind of stories that can be interesting in the Two Rivers, she just says that the Two Rivers contains a more than thousand-year-old history.\nWhen she leaves, they notice a tall man in a color-shifting cloak, moving like a wolf, Lan. They discuss whether they should spend the silver penny she gave them, but decide not to. When Ewin again asks if there really is a gleeman in the village, Rand tells him just to wait and see.

How many battles lost, how many cities burned, before they faced the truth?\"\nWhen Tam goes on telling how they fought all the way to the Shining Walls, Rand stops his father and claps a hand over Tam's muttering as the black cloaked rider, followed by a group of Trollocs, pass by on the road. The black cloaked rider passes back by once again, alone this time, searching from side to side every few steps. The black cloaked rider moves past Rand and his father, then rushes back in its original direction.\nOnce gone, Rand begins carrying the litter again and Tam continues his fever dreams, speaking about Avendesora, the tree of life. Rand begins wondering if all the stories he knows are real.\nTam speaks a broken up tale in his fever dream, \"..battles are always hot, even in the snow. Sweat heat. Blood heat. Only death is cool. Slope of the mountain... only place didn't stink of death. Had to get away from the smell of it... sight of it. ...heard a baby cry. Their women fight alongside the men, sometimes, but why had they let her come, I don't... gave birth there alone, before she died of her wounds... covered her child with her cloak, but the wind... blown the cloak away... child blue with the cold. Should have been dead, too... crying there. Crying in the snow. I couldn't just leave the child... no children of our own... always knew you wanted children. I knew you'd take it to your heart, Kari. Yes, lass. Rand is a good name. A good name.\"\nRand is shocked at Tam's words and stumbles to his knees. Rand looks back at Tam and says, \"You are my father.\" and thinks to himself that Tam is just having fever dreams. Still, Rand asks himself, Who am I?"

Half the village has been burned.\nThe blacksmith, Master Luhhan, rushes to Rand as he comes from the woods and helps him carry Tam to Nynaeve. Egwene, running around trying to help others, leads Rand and Master Luhhan to Nynaeve.\nMaster Luhhan speaks a bit of the night while they wait for Egwene to get Nynaeve. He tells Rand that Mat's alive and that they will pick up the pieces and build again and that the Light will take care of them and if it doesn't they will take care of themselves. Then Master Luhhan leaves Rand to wait for Nynaeve, saying he has things to do.\nNynaeve looks Tam over but says she can do nothing for him. Nynaeve knows what her medicines can do and also knows when it's too late to help someone. Rand protests, but Nynaeve tells him she has to help those she knows she can help. Rand's hope crumbles and he feels empty. Thinking the Mayor will know what to do, Rand heads to the Winespring Inn.\nThom is outside the inn and helps Rand carry Tam inside. The Mayor is surprised to see the al'Thors alive and helps Rand get Tam to a bed.\nHe speaks to Rand of the night and how Moiraine called a ball of lightning down from the sky and Lan was a whirlwind with his sword, that he was a weapon himself, seeming to be in ten places at once fighting the Trollocs.\nAfter a little prompting from Thom, the Mayor suddenly realizes there is a way to help Tam. Mayor al'Vere tells Rand how Aes Sedai can Heal, and though nobody ever wants to get involved with Aes Sedai, its the only chance he can see to help Tam. Rand is willing to do anything, even deal with the Aes Sedai, to save Tam.\nRand goes and finds Moiraine and Lan who are searching the dead Trollocs. The Aes Sedai and her Warder discover Trollocs are working together in a way not seen since the Trolloc Wars. Moiraine says she fears they are further behind than ever.\nMoiraine murmurs that there is 'A little more light in the darkness' when she sees Rand and asks him how his dreams are. Rand isn't concerned with dreams at the time and tells her about his father, saying he'll pay any price to save Tam. Moiraine is tired, but agrees to do what she can do for Rand's father."

Thom not wanting to be near or have anything to do with Aes Sedai leaves the room and Lan says he doesn't like the gleeman, he doesn't trust him and saw nothing of him during the attack the night before. Master al'Vere mentions that Thom was there and didn't get his cloak singed sitting in front of the fireplace.\nRand doesn't care what the gleeman did and pleads to stay near his father when Moiraine tells everyone to leave. Moiraine impatiently agrees to let Rand remain and says he may talk, but to do so quietly.\nMoiraine begins using the One Power to ease Tam's breathing while Lan and Rand speak in quiet tones. Lan remarks about the sword Rand is carrying, saying how strange it is to see a sheepherder with one. He asks Rand if it by chance has any herons on it, to which Rand replies it does, however Rand is more concerned with what Moiraine is doing. Lan comments that he didn't think to find a heron-mark sword in a place like the Two Rivers and Rand tells him it's Tam's sword, that he'd bought it a long time ago.\nRand watches Moiraine and Tam while talking quietly with the Warder, he says Tam never had any use for the sword, until last night. Lan goes on to tell Rand that in some lands the heron is the symbol of a master swordsman and Tam must not always have thought it was useless.\nRand asks about the night before, about what the mayor told him they (Moiraine and Lan) had done. He asks the Warder if they could have done something differently if they had known about the black cloaked rider sooner. Moiraine jumps into the conversation saying even then they couldn't have done much more without half a dozen of her sisters. She says that by herself, a month's warning wouldn't have made much difference, that there was an entire fist of Trollocs, well over one hundred around the district and that one person can only do so much, even with the One Power.\nMoiraine says that she'll not have Rand thinking he is to blame, that the raven they saw the day before should've warned her, but she was too overconfident. Rand is confused about the raven and Lan explains that they are often used as spies for the Dark One as are rats and crows.\nMoiraine then explains that Tam's wound came from a tainted blade forged in the valley of Thakan'dar on the slopes of Shayol Ghul. The wound will not heal unaided and if left alone will grow again and consume Tam.\nMoiraine uses an angreal carved out of ivory and in the shape of a woman in flowing robes to aid in Healing Tam. Once Moiraine finishes Healing Tam, she joins Lan and Rand's talk. They explain to Rand about the attack and tell him he has to leave the Two Rivers if he wants to protect it.\nThe Trollocs had a purpose in their attack, to kill or capture young men Rand's age, which includes Perrin and Mat. The Myrddraal was after them and nobody else. Rand doesn't understand why and Moiraine tells him his answers cannot be found in The Two Rivers and that there is something about one or all of them that the Dark One fears. Rand can't believe what he's hearing. They tell him the Myrddraal and Trollocs will be back and Rand begins to understand why he has to leave. Moiraine tells Rand that Tar Valon is a place of safety and he can find the answers to his questions there.\nMoiraine and Lan plan to leave after full dark and in secret. The Aes Sedai and Warder then depart to find Perrin and Mat.\nThe Mayor and his wife return with food for Rand and suggest he get some sleep. Rand agrees, although he tries to stay up in case Tam awakes."

A spiking black mountain appears and a voice calling \"Serve me\" follows him. Rand throws himself over an edge not wanting to face the Dark One.\nRand's dream changes and he's looking at Tar Valon, before being chased and falling again. He's then on one of the bridges leading into the city and people are gesturing him towards the Tower. Rand tries going other ways, but the Tower is always straight ahead. The crowd leads him on to the Tower and he goes in to find a Myrddraal waiting for him.\nRand awakens suddenly and finds it's twilight. Going to Tam, Rand discovers his father is awake now, yet weak. Rand tells Tam most of what happened, though leaves out Tam's fever dreams and the question he's afraid to ask, is Tam his father?\nRand tells Tam what Moiraine said about having to leave the Two Rivers. Tam says that Aes Sedai are tricksome, that while they do tell the truth, it is often not what you think it is and he should take care around Moiraine. Tam wants to leave with them except that he needs time to recover.\nLan shows up with a warning that they may have trouble. Tam and Rand make quick goodbyes and Tam tells Rand to keep the sword.\nRand, Mat and Lan watch from inside the Inn as a crowd of village men face Moiraine, telling her to leave Emond's Field and blaming her for the Trolloc attack. Mayor al'Vere and Master Luhhan come to break up the crowd.\nMoiraine, angered by the crowd, tells them their history, that of Manetheren. She tells them of King Aemon and Queen Eldrene, 'bravery, beauty, wisdom and love that death could not sunder.' The Red Eagle banner of Manetheren was at the head of every battle that raged during the Trolloc Wars.\nA Trolloc army moved against the home of Manetheren while its soldiers were away on the Field of Bekkar. The men of Manetheren marched home as if their feet had wings and when the armies of the Dark One reached their lands, the men of Manetheren were waiting for them.\nAemon sent word for help and was promised aid if they could hold three days. The men of Manetheren held back the Trolloc hoards for ten days, aid never came and they could no longer hold back the Dark One's armies. Aemon then sent word throughout his land for his people to flee and find safety.\nIt first came in a trickle then a river and a flood, the people of Manetheren did not flee, rather came to defend their home.\nThe time came when the people of Manetheren were surrounded in what would one day become Emond's Field, no man or woman who stood beneath the Red Eagle banner that day lived to see the night. Manetheren, called 'The sword that could not be broken' was shattered.\nEldrene, alone in the city of Manetheren, felt her husband Aemon die and was filled with vengeance for her love, her people and her land. In her grief Eldrene drew on the True Source and hurled the One Power at the army of Trollocs. The Dreadlords died wherever they were and the Dark One's victorious army fled.\nThe Trollocs were hunted down by other armies in other lands, none of those who murdered the people of Manetheren at Aemon's Field lived.\nDrawing on too much of the One Power, Eldrene died as the Dreadlords did, she and Manetheren were both consumed by fire. The people paid for their land with blood and were bound to it.\nAfter Moiraine's tale, the crowd is ashamed of their actions and breaks up. Lan tells Rand and Mat that it's time to go."

She gives Rand a sharp look, but says, \"what is done is already woven in the Pattern\".\nWhen Lan suggests that they leave immediately, Egwene walks in and says that they won't leave without her. She had spotted Mat and Perrin sneaking around like \"bull calves pretending to be foxes\" and when she put that together with Lan buying more horses, she could only see one answer. When the boys try to get her to change her mind and remind her about the trollocs, she asks them to spare her those \"nonsensical tales\". Moiraine decides that she may come with them, and after a discussion with Lan, he agrees as well. The Warder tells her that she can \"ride the gleeman's horse\", when suddenly Thom's voice comes from the hayloft saying that it \"will not be possible\". They let him come with them after some discussion with him.\nWhen they've mounted their horses, the Warder talks about how much better it would be if there were wolves there. The villagers are shocked and wonder how he can want wolves, so he explains that wolves don't like trollocs and trollocs don't like wolves. Therefore they could be sure that there were no trollocs waiting for them if they'd heard wolves.\nThey ride out of the stables, but when they're just about to leave the stable yard, Lan stops them.\nThey see the Watch patrolling - a dozen men from the village and the surrounding farms, armed with spears and wood axes, some armored with helmets or pieces of armour that had lain in attics for generations.\nAfter they've passed, Lan remarks that two Dha'vol trollocs would have them all for breakfast, but at least they have eyes and ears. The party rides over the Winespring Water onto the far bank, and stops from time to time at Lan's signal, each time a patrol passes.\nWhen they're on the North Road and out of the village, Rand suddenly stops and looks at a creature as big as a man with wings like a bat. Lan tells them that it's a Draghkar, and Moiraine says that if the Trollocs have a Draghkar at their command they will soon know where they are.\nThe villagers asks what a Draghkar is, and Thom explains that \"in the war that ended the Age of Legends, worse than Trollocs and Halfmen were created\". Before they get a chance to ask him more questions, Lan tells them that they shall continue down the North Road and follow his lead \"for their lives\""

When they dismount, Rand spots some lights ahead of them, and is shocked when he realises that they've reached Watch Hill that fast.\nThe villagers and Thom say that they should stop for the night at Watch Hill and celebrate Bel Tine, at Watch Hill, there had been no Trollocs, but Lan says that they cannot stop until they're across the Taren. When they protest and say that the horses need rest, they realise that Moiraine is Healing the horses.\nMoiraine remarks that Bela is the least weary of all the horses, and suddenly they hear the Draghkar's scream. It sounds like \"a man dying under sharp knives\". The horses panic, and when the Draghkar shrieks again, Lan commands them to mount the horses fast, as it would not have showed itself unless it already had reported to the Myrddraal.\nThey gallop fast, pursued by the Draghkar's cries. Fog envelops the riders, vanishes and comes again, before they suddenly ride into a \"wall of pale gray\". Moiraine says that she will use the Myrddraal's own slyness against it. As they ride through the thick fog, the shrieks that had hounded them fade, and eventually stop.\nAfter some hours of riding, Lan stops them again. Rand sees some strangely tall houses around him; they had reached the Taren Ferry. They continue deeper into the village, before stopping in front of a tall, dark house that looked the same as the others in the village. Lan hammers his fist at the door, and tells the man who opens, Master Hightower, that they want to cross over on his ferry. He replies that they can come back when the sun is up and the fog is gone, but changes his mind when the Warder gives him some gold coins, promising the same amount when they're over.\nMaster Hightower tells them to wait at the ferry, and goes to rouse his haulers."

Rand and Lan put their hands on their sword hilts, Mat, a hand on his quiver, Perrin eases his axe in its leather loop and Thom starts trimming his fingernails with a dagger. These actions seem to make Master Hightower nervous, and he quickly points out that the gold he got is now safely hidden.\nThey then enter the ferry, \"a wooden barge with high sides, boarded by a ramp,\" and as soon as they've gathered in the center of the ferry, they start crossing the River Taren.\nWhen Rand quietly asks Lan whether they would've tried to rob them, the Warder replies \"when what they do is hidden, men sometimes deal with strangers in ways they wouldn't if there were other eyes to see.\"\nAfter a journey in silence, they arrive on the other side, where Master Hightower gets his gold, and the haulers a silver mark each for \"the quick crossing\". As he eyes Lan's purse greedily, the ferry suddenly gets loose with a loud creak. It's taken in a whirlpool, and Lan gives Master Hightower some more gold, before he and his haulers start trotting up the riverside.\nWhen Thom asks why Moiraine doesn't cover them with fog on this side of the river as the Draghkar can easily see them where they are, she tells him that Draghkar are not very smart, and that the Myrddraal probably will have to divide his efforts to find them. Mat asks awkwardly about the ferry, and she explains that she intends\u200b to get them safely to Tar Valon.\nThey then walk up the riverbank and into the woods where they stop at a dried-up watercourse, hidden under a heap of trees. Lan tells them that he expected them to stop there, as it \"seemed a likely place\". He then goes to check the horses.\nMoiraine asks Egwene if they can talk, and they crawl into a pile of tree trunks to talk for themselves.\nLan hands the others feedbags and some oats for the horses. When Perrin remarks that it doesn't look like they need any rest, the Warder tells them that they can run at their fastest until the second they drop dead by exhaustion they never even felt.\nThey can hear the Draghkar's shrieks, but according to Lan, it's just searching the river for them.\nThe rest of the party then crawls into the opening Egwene and Moiraine had gone into, where they find a cave with a roof of tree trunks and branches. Moiraine and Egwene sit on the other side of a fire, Moiraine talking about the One Power. She tells Egwene that she is one of the handful who don't have to learn to use the One Power as she is born with it, and will eventually start to channel.\nShe holds up a blue stone and guides Egwene in her first attempt to channel light into it, and she manages to produce a small flicker all by her own. Moiraine tells her that she has accomplished something most women who come to the Tower take months to learn, and that she one day even may become the Amyrlin Seat.

Lan also spends time teaching Rand, Mat and Perrin how to use their weapons. Each of the boys do quite well with a bow, and then Lan teaches Rand how to use his sword and Perrin his axe.\nRand watches Egwene unbraid her hair one morning and asks her why she did that. Egwene tells him that she'll be Aes Sedai and that they don't braid their hair unless they want to. Rand and Egwene argue for a bit until Lan speaks up reminding them they need to be quiet.\nMat begins thinking that they've lost the Trollocs for good and wants to explore the world. Moiraine and Egwene return from one of their talks just then and Moiraine asks if they've already forgotten Winternight. She tells them again that the Dark One is after one or all of them and that she will destroy them herself before she allows the Dark One to have them.\nRand is bothered by Moiraine and Egwene going off to speak alone each night, so after everyone else settles down one night, he sneaks off to find out what they're doing. They speak a bit of the Five Powers. Egwene wants to be reassured that female Aes Sedai are not evil, that it was the men who broke the world. Moiraine tells her that the men who broke the world were not evil, they were insane. Moiraine also tells her that Aes Sedai are still human, that in Tar Valon, she'll meet both kind and cruel Aes Sedai, brave and cowardly, strong and weak.

The gatekeeper, Avin, says he didn't know it was them and opens the gate.\nMoiraine and Lan speak with Avin, he tells them that Whitecloaks are in the city and though they haven't caused much trouble, nobody wants them there. He also mentions a man in Ghealdan claiming to be The Dragon with an army moving towards Tear and that Aes Sedai were sent to Ghealdan, though some or all are said to be dead.\nMoiraine leads them off and Rand asks Thom about the rumors Avin spoke of. Thom tells Rand a bit of the Karaethon Cycle. Of the Stone of Tear, and if it falls it'll be one of the major proofs that the Dragon is reborn. The prophecies don't make much sense to Rand and Thom tells him that they wouldn't be much for prophecies if they were easy to fulfill.\nThey arrive at the Stag and Lion through a back gate into the stables. The innkeeper, Master Fitch welcomes them and leads everyone inside telling them of the best hot meals and warm beds in Baerlon and the hottest, best baths too."

Moiraine asks about the Children of the Light being in town and Fitch says not to worry, they're up to tricks claiming there are Aes Sedai in Baerlon. A servant named Ara arrives to lead Rand, Mat, Perrin and Thom away to hot baths while another leads Moiraine and Egwene away.\nIn the bath chamber, Ara makes a few comments about Ghealdan trouble and Trollocs in Saldaea. Mat nearly tells him about Trollocs in the Two Rivers except for Rand, Perrin and Thom putting in words just in time to stop him. Lan shows up in the baths, sends Ara away and lectures the boys again about what they say.\nAfter the baths, Rand spots a girl in mens clothing and short hair with Moiraine. She looks at them sharply, nods to Moiraine and then hurries away.\nThey then settle down for some dinner in a private dinning room. They listen to Lan speak of the rumors people are saying around town. Of the false Dragon Logain being the victor in Ghealdan. He says there are no strangers that could be Myrddraal and certainly no Trollocs. Also that Whitecloaks are in town and trying to make things difficult for the Governor. Moiraine suggests that they remain in Baerlon a couple days and Lan agrees so long as they remember what he told them.\nReturning to his room, Rand drifts to sleep. Rand finds himself in a shadowy stone hallway with doors spaced at regular intervals. He walks down the unchanging hallway for a long time before opening one of the doors into a grim, stone walled chamber. Rand finds a man in dark clothing with a mouth and eyes of flame. Rand hurls himself out of the room, across the hallway and into another room, identical to the first with the same man there waiting for him, Ba'alzamon.\nBa'alzamon asks Rand if he was told that the Eye of the World would serve him. He also says that the Amyrlin Seat will use him until there is nothing left of him.\nRand is frightened and tells Ba'alzamon that he is bound in Shayol Ghul. Ba'alzamon says that he has never been bound, that he was with Lews Therin Kinslayer when he killed everyone he cared for. And that he whispered in Artur Hawkwing's ear and Aes Sedai died. He whispered again and the High King sent his armies across the Aryth Ocean dooming his dream of one land and one king. Ba'alzamon says that if he could control those men, what chance does Rand have.\nRand insists that he is dreaming. Ba'alzamon curves his finger and breaks a rat's back then tries to break Rand's back to prove to him he is not dreaming.\nRand awakes and finds Lan and Thom asleep. Rand wonders if Moiraine can help with the dreams and if he can trust her. Slowly sleep comes back over him."

He notices that Lan's sword is gone and decides to follow the Warder's example and take his own sword.\nRand goes downstairs to find Master Fitch and Sara (the inn's cook) in an argument about Sara's cat and dead rats being found around the inn. After Fitch leaves, Sara has one of the servants bring Rand some food and she tells him that his friends have all gone out into the city, except one who wasn't feeling well. She makes a comment about the rats being found and their backs being broken. Rand's food loses all taste, and he feels that he has to talk to someone.\nRand finds Perrin in his room and Perrin tells him he isn't feeling well after some bad dreams and not sleeping through the night. They discover they had the same dream or close enough anyway and wonder if Mat too had a similar dream.\nRand wants to go out into the city but Perrin says he doesn't and that he'll catch up later. Rand goes outside to see more people than he'd ever seen before. He doesn't feel good about leaving Perrin behind and thinks that Thom may finish his performance, then he could talk with him so Rand sits down on a barrel in the back of the inn to wait a little while.\nRand meets Min while waiting and she tells him about seeing things about people and the Pattern. She says that they are all tied together in the Pattern. When Rand asks about Egwene, Min tells him she is tied in too and that while they both love each other, they are not for one another the way they both want. She mentions a few images she sees around Lan, Thom, Perrin and Mat. Rand then asks about himself and she replies with a list of things, then says that she sees three women standing over a funeral bier with him on it and black rock wet with blood. Rand breaks in and says that's enough.\nRand quickly leaves Min and moves into the crowed street. He wanders through the crowd taking in the city until he spots Padan Fain. Fain darts away into an alley and Rand follows after him.\nFain is acting oddly and talks about running since Winternight. Rand tells him that they thought he was dead, that they are staying at the Stag and Lion and that he should come back with him. Rand thinks Moiraine will help him out but Fain doesn't want her help and asks Rand to promise not to tell her that he'd seem him alive. Rand promises and Fain dashes away and around a corner.\nRand chases after Fain and crashes into Mat. Mat and Rand share a few words about seeing Fain and then about their dreams.\nRand and Mat start heading back to the inn when they see three Whitecloaks. Mat thinks that they are full of themselves and slips away and up onto a rooftop. Using his sling, Mat breaks a stake holding back a dozen barrels causing them to roll away and splash mud on the Whitecloaks.\nRand laughs and soon finds himself face to face with the Children of the Light. They see Rand's sword and ask him questions. Rand avoids answering them and one of them, Bornhald, asks him what evil is in him that he refuses to answer.\nIn the middle of the Whitecloaks' threats the City Watch appears up the street. Bornhald calls out that Baerlon stands in the Shadow of the Dark One. He then tells Rand that Darkfriends do not escape them.\nThe Whitecloaks move on and Mat comes out of hiding in a shop. Mat tells Rand he's crazy and they start back to the inn meeting Thom on the way. Mat begins to tell Thom about the dream and when Rand mentions Ba'alzamon, Thom hurries them into an alley warning them never to speak that name where someone could hear.\nAfter they tell Thom about the men the Dark One mentioned in their dream, Thom tells them to keep their dream quiet for now and wonders if Perrin has the sense to. They hurry back to the inn and Perrin is just running out as they arrive. Perrin says he didn't tell anyone about the dream.\nPerrin then says that he was coming to look for them and tell them that Nynaeve came after them and is inside the inn."

Thom hurries Rand on but Min replies to the bard that he should go juggle something. Rand protests but Min quiets him. She tells him that a young woman with dark eyes and dark, braided hair arrived at the inn a while ago. Min saw a lot of sparks around her, just as she had with Rand and the others. Rand understands that it's Nynaeve, but tells Min that she won't harm them.\nHe meets up with the others and tells them that Nynaeve is 'a part of it'. They ask what she's part of and if Min knows something, but Mat says grumpily that she's a part of the same bad luck they've had since Winternight. Rand quickly tells them that she saw Nynaeve arrive and talk to Mistress Alys and thought she might have something to do with them, something his friends accepts. Rand dislikes keeping things secret from his friends, but thinks that Min's secret can be dangerous for her, so he holds his tongue.\nWhen the party enter the room they'd eaten in the night before, Moiraine, Nynaeve and Egwene are seated and Lan is leaning against the mantel.\nThe rest of the men sit down and Lan offers Nynaeve a cup of wine as he asks her how she found them. When she tells him that she followed their trail, Lan looks surprised and remarks that he must be getting careless. She says that her father often took her hunting with him and taught her what he would have taught the sons he never had.\nWhen Nynaeve asks why she should help hide them, Thom tells her that there are people in Baerlon that would kill Moiraine for what she is, and Lan too. And since the rest are all associated with them, it's enough facts for the Whitecloaks. He says that the Whitecloak Questioners assume that you're guilty even before they start the interrogation and don't care about finding the truth.\nRand says that they must go on to Tar Valon when the Aes Sedai and the Wisdom start discussing what is safest for them. At last Moiraine tells Egwene and the others to leave her and Nynaeve alone and everybody but the two women leaves the room.\nRand starts wondering how Nynaeve can be a part of it and how any of them can be involved with Trollocs and Fades at all. The villagers stand outside the door with Lan for a while before Nynaeve walks out. When she looks at Rand, he realizes that the others had quietly left him alone with the Wisdom. When Rand asks her whether she's going to join them, she tells him that Mavra Mallen came from Deven Ride to see to things and that she'll want to return as soon as she can.\nShe tells him that the village meeting had been a shambles and that while everybody agreed that somebody should be sent for them, it didn't seem that they would come to an agreement on who should be sent. Nynaeve called the Woman's Circle together and told them what needed to be done, and while they didn't like it, they saw the right of it, and therefore she came.\nWhen Rand asks her about what Moiraine had told her, she says that she asked some questions about the boys and when Rand tells him that Tam had said he wasn't his son, she tells him that people say weird things in a fever, things that are not true.\nFurther on, she says that when Tam returned to Emond's Field, he brought a red-haired outlander wife and a babe. Kari al'Thor took care of that babe with as much love and delight as any other woman with a babe.\nRand then asks her what she's going to do and she tells him that they will have to see."

When he enters the crowded room he sees that Thom is performing The Great Hunt of the Horn and he makes his way and sits down next to Perrin and Mat.\nThe gleeman performs 'The Bargain of Rogosh Eagle-eye', 'Lian's Stand', 'The Fall of Aleth-Loriel', 'Gaidal Cain's Sword' and 'The Last Ride of Buad of Albhain'. Finally he exchanges his harp with his flute and two men join him with a drum and a hammered dulcimer.\nThey clear the room for dancing and when Rand dances, he finds himself staring at a man with a scar crossing his whole face. He quickly looks away and wonders if he has insulted the man. Rand then dances with Nynaeve, Moiraine and Egwene before sitting down on the bench.\nToward midnight Moiraine and Egwene leave, and after one dance Nynaeve follows them. Lan walks up to Mat, Perrin and Rand and tells them that they should get to bed since they need to make an early start. Mat tells the Warder that a scarred man has been staring at him and Rand says that he stared at him too. Lan says that according to Master Fitch he's a spy for the Whitecloaks, but no worry for them.\nThe others go to their rooms but Rand decides to get some milk. He hurries to the kitchen and when he come out, a Fade walks toward him from the shadows and tells him that he is one of them. Rand wants to run but he cannot break free from the eye-less gaze. The Myrddraal says that Rand belongs to the Great Lord of the Dark before it darts down the hall and loses itself in the shadows. Lan leaps down the stairs, sword in hand, when Rand tells him what has happened. He says that they are leaving. The others join them and they walk to the stables to get their horses.\nThey ride down the streets of Baerlon alone, and when they reach the Caemlyn Gate, Lan wakes a Watchman and makes him open the gates. Five Whitecloaks appear and asks them who they are and why they want to leave at night. They tell them that a Draghkar has been seen flying over the town.\nOne of the Whitecloaks, Bornhald, recognizes Rand and tells the Watchmen that Rand's party are Darkfriends and that they will take them to their camp. Moiraine then starts talking, her voice coming from every direction. She seems to grow taller and Bornhald shouts 'Aes Sedai' while unsheathing his sword to attack Moiraine. She blocks his attack with her staff causing the Whitecloak to hurl back into his companions, sending them all down in a heap.\nLan commands the others through the gate and when Rand turns, he sees that Moiraine's head and shoulders are above the wall. They stop about fifty paces from the wall and watch the Aes Sedai step over the wall. When her feet are on the ground outside, she's suddenly back to her normal size again.\nEven though Bornhald commands the Watchmen to hold the gates, they close and seal them. When Moiraine catches up with them, Egwene looks at her in awe and says how she was taller than a giant. She responds by saying that the mind plays tricks at night and the eye sees what is not there.\nThey move down the Caemlyn Road at an easy pace. After an hour, they see flames over Baerlon and Moiraine tells them that it's the inn. Nynaeve gets angry and asks her how she can say it so easily and why she doesn't help. The Aes Sedai tells her that she will send Master Fitch gold enough to rebuild the Stag and Lion. They continue their trip down the road till they make camp. Lan gives them one hour to sleep on.\nMat, Perrin and Rand whisper about whether they will be safe in Tar Valon before they fall asleep at last.\nLan wakes them just before dawn, and once they have rolled the blankets together and strapped them behind their saddles, they start riding again. At sunrise they eat breakfast in their saddles, all bleary-eyed and huddling in their cloaks except Lan. The Warder's eyes are searching constantly as if he expects an ambush at any moment."

Lan is studying the road ahead and behind while the others sit under some trees eating. Egwene talks about how good some tea would've been and Nynaeve tells her that flatwort tea and andilay root are best for fatigue. The Warder tells them that they have a Fade or two and their Trollocs on their tail who know what road they're taking. Thom asks what stops them from having someone or something at Whitebridge already when a horn sounds from the west. The Warder tells him that nothing stops them and that they must trust the Light, but now they know for certain that there are Trollocs behind them.\nThey mount their horses when a second horn blows and this time another answers. Lan tells Moiraine to keep them moving and sets off heading west. Moiraine responds \"The Light go with you, last Lord of Seven Towers\", before she moves on with the others at a steady trot. Rand wonders what last Lord of Seven Towers means, when the horns sound again, closer this time, maybe seven or eight miles behind.\nWhen Nynaeve urges them to go faster, the Aes Sedai tells her that that may be what they are wishing for, and keeps the same steady pace.\nEvery time the horns sound, it sounds closer. When Rand thinks they are about five miles away, Lan comes galloping over the hill behind them and tells Moiraine that there are at least three fists of Trollocs, maybe five, each led by a Halfman. He says that they are closing the gap and will be on them in an hour or less. Suddenly a horn sounds in the west, behind them and is answered from one ahead of them.\nThe Aes Sedai says that they can go south or north, when Lan says that there is a place the Trollocs won't go. Moiraine says no, but after some discussion, they decide to go north.\nThey ride through the woods and hear the horns directly behind them. They top a hill and below them they meet an army of Trollocs led by a Myrddraal. The Fade unsheathes its sword and rides at Lan, followed by the Trollocs. The Warder cries to the rest to stay with him before he sets down the hill, shouting \"for the Seven Towers\". The rest of the group streams after Lan, and caught up by Lan's cry, Rand shouts \"Manetheren! Manetheren!\", repeated by Perrin. Mat shouts \"Carai an Caldazar! Carai an Ellisande! Al Ellisande!\"\nThe Warder and Myrddraal fight alone in a clear circle while Rand rides about, swinging his sword with the little skill Lan has taught him. Nynaeve and Egwene are close to Moiraine who lashes out with her staff, causing fire to envelop Trollocs. Rand is surrounded by Trollocs who try to unhorse him when suddenly all of them fall on the ground shouting. He then sees the Myrddraal sitting in its saddle without a head. Thom yells that it won't die until nightfall while Lan urges them on. They can hear the horns from west, east and south.\nRand turns and sees that only a hundred spans is separating the Trollocs and his party. Moiraine climbs down from Aldieb's back and takes out the angreal. With the angreal in one hand and the staff in the other she faces the Trollocs and the three Fades. She raises her staff and stabs it down in the earth, causing the ground to tremble and ripple. The Trollocs begin to tumble down the slope in heaps yet the Myrddraal moves forward in a line, their horses never missing a step. The Aes Sedai then lifts her staff and the earth stills. She points to the hollow between the hills and flames spread as far as the eye can see, creating a wall between the Trollocs and the humans. Lan then makes them go on while he takes care of Moiraine who nearly falls on the ground.\nThey soon catch up with the others and Moiraine tells them that she will be all right soon and that she's not at her strongest while working with Earth and Fire. After some riding, Lan stops and talks alone with Moiraine. Egwene asks Rand about the things he shouted at the Trollocs and he says that they had to shout something, as that's what you do in times like that. Perrin adds that they had a right since Moiraine said they all were descended from Manetheren. Egwene says that it wasn't that she meant, but what Mat was shouting. He tells her that he can't remember where it came from or what it meant, and Egwene says that for a moment she thought she understood him, though it's gone now. Moiraine comes up to them and says that it means 'for the honor of the Red Eagle. For the honor of the Rose of the Sun. The Rose of the Sun'; the ancient warcry of Manetheren and the warcry of its last king. She says that the blood of Arad's lines is strong in the Two Rivers and that the old blood still sings.\nHorns start blowing again, and Lan says the Trollocs have passed the fire and that Moiraine is not strong enough for what she intends and that she needs rest. And neither Myrddraal nor Trolloc will enter that place. Moiraine sighs, but agrees, and gets the others to gather close around her. She stands in her stirrups and starts swinging the staff over their heads, before thrusting it out to the west. She tells them it's for the Trollocs, that their scents and tracks will seem to follow it. They set off again, and soon they reach something that Rand believes is a cliff first but when he looks closer he understands that it is a city at least fifty times as big as Baerlon. When Egwene wonders what city it was, Moiraine tells her that it was called Aridhol and it was an ally to Manetheren in the Trolloc Wars. Later, the place died and got another name: Shadar Logoth."

The largest building in Baerlon would have disappeared in the shadows of almost everything in the city; marble palaces topped with huge domes, bronze fountains, statues and towers. Rand thinks to himself of how Thom, Lan and Moiraine must have laughed up their sleeves at him, thinking Baerlon was a city. He is so caught up in staring at everything that he is taken by surprise when Lan stops them in front of a white stone building, twice as big as the Stag and Lion. Moiraine nods, and Lan commands the 'farm boys' to bring the horses inside.\nThey gather the horses and bring them in where Moiraine is laying. She asks Nynaeve if she has any herbs that will help her sleep an hour and not leave her groggy and the Wisdom tells her about a tea.\nThom, Mat, Perrin and Rand walk into a chamber where they unsaddle their horses. Mat gets a glum stare on his face and Rand asks him what's wrong. He says that he's thinking of Aemon's war cry, and Perrin tells him that maybe he's Aemon reborn when Thom warns him that that is dangerous talk and nothing to be spoken of lightly. The gleeman then goes back to the front room to have a smoke. Mat asks the others why don't they go and see more of the city, but Perrin asks him if he's forgetting the Trollocs. Rand says that Aridhol must have been the greatest city in the Trolloc Wars for the Trollocs to still be afraid of it. They agree at last and walk out on the streets of Aridhol.\nThey wander in and out of the biggest buildings they can find and climb into dusty fountains with huge basins, but find nothing more than dust and rubble. After some time even Mat grows tired and they sit down on the steps of a tall building, arguing about what to do next. Rand wants to go back to sleep, but Mat says that there might be treasure. When Rand tells him that it's getting late, Mat says he wants to climb one of the whole towers. A man's voice then speaks and says that the towers are not safe. They ask him who he is and he introduces himself as Mordeth, a treasure hunter. They tell him that they are going to Caemlyn, and he asks them if they would like to help him carry a treasure he's found to his horses. They accept and he leads them into the building and down some steps before they enter a tile-walled room filled with mounds of jewelry, coins, goblets, platters, swords and gems. They decide to come back tomorrow and explain that Moiraine and Lan will understand when they see an axe Perrin is taking with him. Mordeth asks them if they are alone and Mat answers that they're in the company of Moiraine, Lan, Nynaeve, Egwene and Thom and that they're going to Tar Valon.\nThis causes Mordeth's face to twist in rage and fear and he accuses them of lying to him. Perrin carefully puts the axe back and asks whether they should return tomorrow. When Mordeth is about to answer, Rand figures out what is wrong with Mordeth - he doesn't have a shadow. Mordeth says 'it is decided,' and swells like a balloon. They panic and start yelling then suddenly Mordeth is sitting in the corner of the room clutching his knees to his chest, wailing. He then shouts 'You are all dead!' then disappears.\nThey run up the steps and get out on the streets. From there they keep in the middle of the street and walk fast back to camp. At twilight, they come in sight of the white stone building and they run to it and through the doorway. Everyone except Lan is there. Nynaeve tells them that he is off looking for them. Moiraine asks them what has happened and they start to tell her, all in different places and none in the order it had happened. Moiraine suddenly grabs Rand's wrist at the mention of Mordeth and asks if he gave them anything or touched them. They say no and Mat says that they thought it was safe in the city since Trollocs wouldn't dare coming in. She tells them a story of thousands of Trollocs, Darkfriends, Myrddraal and Dreadlords that had camped in Shadar Logoth late in the Trolloc Wars that never came back out.\nShe then tells them about how the man Mordeth came to Aridhol when it seemed as though the Father of Lies must surely conquer. He spoke to Balwen, the King in Aridhol, and soon he was second only to the King. Aridhol started to draw in on itself, and used the battle cry: 'the victory of the Light is all'. She tells them about how Aridhol was destroyed by itself and named Shadar Logoth, Shadow's Waiting.\nThey then go to sleep but Rand wakes up on Lan's return. Lan tells Moiraine that there are Trollocs inside the gates before he starts waking the others. Moiraine tells them that they will make for the river where she can raise a small ward while they make rafts and cross over, or they may be able to hail a trader's boat from Saldaea. Lan explains that neither Trollocs or Myrddraal can swim and that they loathe deep water. The Aes Sedai commands them to get to their horses, as they're not yet over the river."

The Aes Sedai shouts lowly for him to stop, which he does. The fog is completely covering the streets, and it grows slowly. Lan and Moiraine ride slowly up to the fog which separates them, and when Nynaeve asks what it is, the Aes Sedai tells her about Mashadar, the evil of Shadar Logoth, which kills you by a mere touch and cannot be destroyed, even by the whole White Tower.\nMoiraine points to a star and tells them to follow it, as it will bring them to the river. She and Lan then ride off, leaving the others alone. Rand leads the others in a half trot, and when they round a corner, a wall of fog closes the way. They wheel around and ten spans away, two Trollocs step into the street. Then another pair of Trollocs appear and another, and another, and another. They start howling, before they bound forward.

She warily watches the woods for Trollocs as well as the ground ahead of her for any tracks that'll help lead her to the boys and Egwene.\nNynaeve catches the scent of wood smoke and stalks through the woods to a clearing where Moiraine and Lan are speaking. Hiding behind a tree Nynaeve listens to Moiraine and Lan talk about the Trollocs the night before and wonder how they'd gotten so far from the Borderlands so quickly. Moiraine tells Lan that she'd done some searching and says that one of the boys is across the river and there is a faint trace of the others downriver.\nMoiraine senses Nynaeve and tells her to come out and Lan whirls around drawing his sword. Nynaeve feels some satisfaction that the Warder was unaware of her. Nynaeve approaches Moiraine demanding to know what dirty Aes Sedai schemes she got Egwene and the boys into. Lan raises his arm and bars Nynaeve's way. Moiraine tells Nynaeve that she can wield the One Power and that's how she could sense her. Nynaeve thinks that the Aes Sedai is trying to off balance her and denies what Moiraine says.\nMoiraine talks of the people in Emond's Field telling her about all the wonderful things their young Wisdom could do. Nynaeve only answers that Mistress Barran taught her well. Moiraine goes on saying that some years ago there must've been something Nynaeve wanted more than anything else and she got it. Moiraine says that Nynaeve must've Healed either Egwene or Perrin and that is how she had found them at the inn in Baerlon.\nMoiraine tells Nynaeve that she is lucky to have managed crude control of the Power, that if she hadn't, it would've killed her as it may kill Egwene if she is untrained. Nynaeve replies that if she could learn to control it, so could Egwene. Moiraine says that the reactions from using the Power will eventually lead to a violent death that would last days and that there is nothing that can be done once it's begun.\nNynaeve also learns from Moiraine that she has great potential and with training could become even more powerful than Egwene who could be one of the most powerful in centuries. Nynaeve asks hesitantly for Moiraine not to tell anyone about this.\nWhen asked about the boys, Moiraine says that the Dark One wants them and that she opposes anything the Dark One wants. Moiraine tells Lan that they will be heading south and that the Wisdom will not be accompanying them to which Nynaeve replies that she will, thinking to herself she will not leave the Emond's Fielders alone with an Aes Sedai.\nLan goes to recover Nynaeve's horse and Nynaeve smiles, thinking that he'll never find her tracks. Moiraine says she'll be able to find the boys by a token she had given each of them. Two of the boys have lost their coins though, so Moiraine believes they will need her help first even though the third boy is only a few miles away across the river. Nynaeve is worried about Egwene, but the Aes Sedai says it's the boys the Dark One wants, not Egwene.\nLan returns with Nynaeve's horse and they set out south."

Perrin asks her not to use the One Power and she refuses asking him if he'd give up his axe or walk around with one hand tied behind his back.\nOne afternoon they find Queens Crown mushrooms and begin laughing and telling stories they remember of Emond's Field.\nThey smell smoke of a cook fire and Perrin goes to see what it is, telling Egwene to wait where she is. Perrin goes off and peering around a tree discovers a lean sun browned man resting near the fire. His clothes made of furs. The man peeks an eye open and invites Perrin and his friend over for something to eat. Perrin calls for Egwene and introduces himself to the man. The man then introduces himself as Elyas Machera. Perrin gasps when he notices Elyas eyes were as yellow as polished gold.\nEgwene shows up and Perrin introduces her while she eyes the cooked rabbits Elyas has over the fire. They eat and Elyas asks them what they're doing out in the wilderness. Egwene answers that they're headed for Caemlyn and Elyas laughs, telling them they'll pass a hundred miles north of it going the way they were.\nEgwene asks Elyas if he would show them the way and he responds saying that he doesn't like people much and that cities are full of them. He says he doesn't go near villages or farms much, that people don't like his friends. Egwene wants to know which way to go then Elyas tells them to be quiet, that his friends are coming.\nFour wolves appear and lay down by the fire. Perrin notices more wolf eyes in the darkness around them, he reaches for his axe and Elyas tells him not to do that. Perrin leaves the axe alone.\nElyas named the four wolves by the fire; Dapple, Hopper, Burn and Wind. Perrin wondered how Elyas could talk to them. Elyas says that the wolves are the ones that discover the people not the people them. Elyas tells them that the wolves approached where ever he went. And then they seemed to know what he was thinking and responded to him. He says that wolves and men have not hunted together for a very long time.\nEgwene finds it interesting and wants to know if speaking to the wolves can be taught. Elyas says that it can't be taught, but that Perrin can do it. Perrin shifts uncomfortably.\nElyas still wants to know what they're doing out there and Egwene tells him a story her and Perrin had worked on in case they ever meet anyone. Elyas tells them that they're lying. That the wolves told him so. Perrin then tells Elyas the truth. When Perrin finishes his tale, Elyas says that he doesn't hold well with Aes Sedai, that the Red Ajah wanted to gentle him. And that no Aes Sedai would take kindly to him after he killed a couple Warders. Elyas says it's bad business to kill Warders and that he doesn't like it. Elyas goes on to say that talking to wolves is older than Aes Sedai and doesn't have to do with the One Power.\nElyas offers to Perrin and Egwene to stay with him and the wolves, that it'd be safer for them. Egwene says that they're going to Caemlyn then Tar Valon and Perrin agrees after a sarcastic conversation with himself. Elyas says he and the pack will travel with them, that Dapple says so and she leads the pack.

Ba'alzamon, surprised, fades away.\nRand turns full circle and stares at thousands of reflections of himself staring back. Ba'alzamon appears in each of the reflections behind Rand's own image staring at him, their faces merging together.\nRand starts awake and searching around with his eyes realizes he is aboard the Spray. He is relieved at first until he notices his finger - pricked on the thorns in the dream - is bleeding. Rand's breath catches.\nThe Spray continues down river, Domon drives his crew hard trying to make good speed, all the time reminding them of the Trollocs that attacked them days earlier.

Rand is concerned Gelb will cause them trouble but Thom thinks they have more to worry about from the crew if they mutiny.\nThom entertains Domon's crew and at the same time teaches Rand and Mat to be his apprentices teaching them some of the easier stories, some tumbling and juggling.\nRand watches the shores pass by and notices a tower of polished metal. Domon makes a few comments about the tower, that it's two hundred feet high and has no mark or opening on it. Mat says he bets there's treasure inside. Domon agrees that there may be and then goes on telling about a few other strange sights in the world. He makes a comment about when the Emond's Fielders go back to their home that it'll be too small to contain them. Rand disagrees and says he will go home some day and raise sheep like Tam. Rand then asks Mat if he's right and Mat, pulling himself away from looking at the tower says of course they'll go home, then walks off muttering about treasure.\nA few days pass and Rand sits upon the mast of the ship watching the crew and everything else. He nearly falls at one point and laughs about it. Thom and the crew watch him, thinking that Rand has gone mad and tell him to come down. Rand slides down the mast and jumps to the deck right in front of Mat. Rand stares at Mat and what he held - a curved dagger with a gold scabbard and a ruby the size of Rand's thumb nail. Mat notices Rand and stuffs the dagger back in his coat.

Perrin can feel the wolves and tries to tell Egwene that she doesn't need to worry to which she replies that she isn't worried.\nElyas tells Egwene that the wolves are far enough to avoid any people they meet, yet close enough to help if there is any danger.\nEgwene insists everyone take a turn riding, even Elyas. Elyas replies that his legs are good enough for him. Egwene tries to argue that it makes sense to take turns, but Elyas just looks at her with his yellow eyes and she backs away.\nPerrin feels the wolves around them, when they come, when they're ahead, when they're behind. In his dreams wolves are always nearby. Elyas gets food for Perrin and Egwene, they eat well while with him, but Perrin feels that he'd just as well starve than travel with Elyas and the wolves.\nAs they approach a large grouping of trees, three dogs as tall as the wolves and heavier appeared snarling and baring teeth. Perrin gets his sling ready, but Elyas stops him. Elyas raises a finger and whistles high and shrill, the dogs growling ceases and they step back watching his finger. Lowering his whistle and finger together, the dogs lay down happy as pups. Elyas pats the dogs and says that there will be Tuatha'an, Tinkers. Egwene doesn't like the idea of meeting Tinkers, she thinks they're thieves. Elyas says they steal no more than any other folk and Perrin says he's always wanted to meet a Tinker and suggests they stay with them for the night. Elyas says they may as well stay with them, but not to listen to what the Tuatha'an say. Elyas thinks their views are foolishness. As they walk into the woods, Perrin feels the wolves stay back. The wolves avoid people and were contemptuous of the dogs that gave up their freedom.\nThe Tinkers camp consisted of colorful wagons that were more like houses on wheels. The Tinkers themselves wore clothes as colorful as the wagons, so colorful it hurt Perrin's eyes to look at. The Tinkers played music and danced, children played with dogs. The music and merriment stops as Perrin, Elyas and Egwene walk up and everyone stares at them. A man, Raen-the Mahdi (old tongue for 'Seeker' - the leader of the Tuatha'an people) approaches and says they are welcome to their fires and asks if they know the song. Elyas replies with a bow and says he does not know the song. The man then says they will continue to seek then and welcomes them to dinner, the merriment picks back up again.\nRaen and Elyas already know each other from years back. Egwene asks about the song that was mentioned and Elyas says that it is what they seek, that it was lost during the Breaking of the World and when it's found again the paradise of the Age of Legends will return. Elyas says the Tinkers don't even know anything about the song but believe they'll know it when they find it.\nThey join Raen at his campfire and meet Ila, Raen's wife and Aram their grandson. Aram takes a liking to Egwene. Aram mentions the Way of the Leaf and Egwene asks about it. Aram explains that the leaf lives its appointed time, doesn't struggle against the wind, does no harm and lastly falls to the ground to nourish new leaves. Perrin asks what it means and Raen replies that no man should harm another person whatsoever. Raen says 'violence harms the person who does it as much as the one who receives it.' Elyas grows impatient with the talk and calls for enough of it, he says people don't like Tinkers because they preach their Way of the Leaf and that it lures young folk away from their homes. Raen is patient with Elyas and Perrin's views. Perrin tells Raen he doesn't look for trouble, but if someone caused some for him, he'd give it back to them. Egwene finds it interesting to meet someone who doesn't think his muscles can solve everything. Aram invites Egwene to show her the camp and she accepts going off with him. Raen says Aram is a good lad, but seems to find the Way of the Leaf a hard way to live.\nThey eat dinner and after lighting their pipes, Raen tells a tale about a band of Tinkers crossing the Waste two years earlier. The Tinkers encountered a group of Far Dareis Mai-Maidens of the Spear who had gone into the Blight and were returning when they were attacked by Trollocs that had followed them. The Maidens were all dead save one who crawled to the Tinkers wagons to give them a message despite her loathing of them. \"Leafblighter means to blind the Eye of the World. He means to slay the Great Serpent. Warn the People. Sightburner comes. Tell them to stand ready for He Who Comes With the Dawn.\" and as she continued her warning message, she died. Raen thinks Elyas might know something, but he doesn't.\nPerrin thinks over the Aiel woman's message and wonders about Elyas when Egwene returns, singing to herself. Egwene says Aram is a nice boy and she had fun dancing, laughing and eating dinner with him. Egwene suddenly throws her arms around Perrin and weeps into his shirt begging him to tell her that their friends are alive. Perrin says they are and she brushes tears quickly from her face, saying goodnight and giving him a kiss on the cheek. Perrin thinks that Rand might have understood what just happened, but he himself doesn't. Perrin hears the wolves howl in the distance, they would be waiting for him in his dreams."

Mat wonders why Thom bothers since neither of them are planning to become a gleeman. Thom raises the question of what Rand and Mat intend to do if they do not find Moiraine in Whitebridge. Before the boys can answer the ship arrives in Whitebridge.\nCaptain Domon tells Floran Gelb to get off his ship and offers Thom and the boys passage to Illian if they will keep the crew motivated to work as hard as they have on the way to Whitebridge. Thom wants to take the offer but the boys want to search for Moiraine, so Thom tells Domon he will consider it.\nThom takes Rand and Mat to the town center passing the White Bridge - a remnant from the Age of Legends that gave the town its name. They enter The Wayfarers' Rest and ask Innkeeper Bartim for a place where they can talk in private. Bartim leads them to a table and offers Thom a room and a meal for a good price if he will perform tonight. Thom says he will consider it, and tells the boys when Bartim has gone to get them a drink that the offer is cheap.\nWhen Batrim returns they ask him for news. Bartim tells them about the false Dragon Logain, how he was captured and that he can channel. He also tells them something about the Hunt of the Horn being called in Illian. Thom considers going to Illian again. Rand inquires after their companions while Thom is lost in thought for a moment. The innkeeper's reaction to that is peculiar. He wants them to leave as soon as they finish their drinks. After some more questions they learn that both Fain and a Fade inquired after them.\nThe Innkeeper leaves again and Thom urges the boys to take Domon's offer. Rand and Mat still refuse. Mat is on the brink of violence and clutches his dagger. At that moment they hear Gelb telling stories about Trollocs chasing Domon's ship. Thom now sees himself forced to abandon the plan to go to Illian. Rand and Mat want to know why Thom stays with them. Thom tells him about his nephew Owyn who got in trouble with Aes Sedai. Rand suspects Owyn could channel but Thom doesn't admit that. They decide to sneak out of the inn and make a run for it to Caemlyn.\nThom divides their coin into three shares and they sneak out of the inn. Thom hands Rand his things while he goes to get another cloak to replace his gleeman one. As they head for the road to Caemlyn a Fade appears. Thom turns to face it and tells the boys to run and go to an inn in Caemlyn called The Queen's Blessing. Rand and Mat hear Thom cry out in pain as they flee towards the Caemlyn Road. Mat thinks Thom is dead, but Rand has trouble accepting that."

He erases the tracks at their camps, evades the ridges of hills, where they could be seen for miles around, and even sends out the wolves to scout ahead. The wolves cannot tell Perrin what makes Elyas uneasy though. When Perrin asks what they are running for Elyas reacts agitated but does not give a straight answer.\nWhen they approach a hill that stretches for miles in either direction there is no other choice than to go cross it. Perrin joins Elyas scouting and when they reach the top they spot the first ravens. A small group, maybe fifty or a hundred, but they are convinced these are eyes of the Dark One.\nAfter that Elyas pushes for more speed and tells the wolves to watch the skies (something wolves normally don't do). They spot ever bigger groups of ravens closer and their journey becomes a dash for a 'place of safety' as Elyas calls it. At one point the wolves let Perrin know the ravens are behind him as well. Perrin is forced to tell the others and Egwene immediately realizes Elyas is right and Perrin can talk to them. Perrin refuses to discuss it though. Ravens now cloud the sky. Several times Egwene's and Perrin's slings are all that save them from being detected. They see animals that have fallen victim to the ravens and at one point they even see the ravens kill a fox. Perrin also feels the ravens attack the wolves before they are being drawn away by the real prey of this hunt.\nJust as Perrin and Egwene are about to collapse from exhaustion, Perrin feels a chill going through him. Elyas tells him they have entered a stedding, the home of Ogier only known in stories in the Two Rivers. The eyes of the Dark One will not follow them there. They are safe for the moment.\nElyas leads them to the only place where there is water in the abandoned stedding. Egwene notices the remains of a statue at their campsite which looks like it has hosted generations of travelers before them. Elyas tells them it was a statue of Artur Hawkwing, the king who ruled all the lands between the Aryth Ocean and the Aiel Waste. Elyas tells them his story as they rest by the campfire. Perrin's mood is low that night. He still will not accept the wolves as a part of him. He also wonders if he could have killed Egwene to spare her from being torn to pieces by the ravens if they had caught up with them."

Keep the axe a while longer and throw it away when the hate for it disappears. Before Perrin can consider this, the wolves send an urgent messages. Many horsemen are on the way.\nElyas and Perrin rush to the camp and douse the fire. There is no time to hide the traces, Elyas tells them to hide instead. He goes to join the wolves and says he will find them later. After he disappears into the twilight Egwene demands to know what is going on. Perrin tells her what the wolves told him as they look for a place to hide.\nIt is totally dark when they find a suitable place to hide. Perrin notices for the first time his eyesight has improved greatly. He can still see fine. He feels the wolves being chased by the horsemen. Still not recovered from their encounter with the ravens the wolves and Elyas try to drive the men back to their camp. The men keep on searching though. Getting ever closer to Perrin and Egwene.\nAt last they are discovered. Egwene and Perrin are about to surrender when Hopper comes charging out of the bushes and attacks one of the men. The men kill Hopper while Perrin, who feels the wolf die, jumps into the battle. Moments later he is knocked unconscious.\nWhen Perrin wakes up he and Egwene are tied up in a tent in the company of a Lord Captain Commander of the Children of the Light. He is going through their things when one of his men, Child Byar, enters the tent to report. He overestimates the number of wolves and men that attacked the Children to hide the fact that he failed in finding any besides Perrin and Egwene. The Lord Captain Commander is not that easily fooled though.\nHe now introduces himself as Geofram Bornhald and starts to ask Perrin questions. Bornhald gets ever more convinced Perrin and Egwene are Darkfriends. Perrin decides to tell an edited version of the truth but Bornhald does not buy it. He tells the prisoners they will be taken to Amador for interrogation. This triggers loud protests of Child Byar who has been hostile to Perrin and Egwene from the beginning. He claims they will slow the Children down on their way to Caemlyn and that there is only one penalty for Darkfriends. Death.\nBornhald tells Byar not to be overzealous. He advises Egwene to think of a better story, preferably the truth, if she wants to escape being handed over to the Hand of the Light. He also makes it clear that a gibbet waits for Perrin for killing two Children of the Light."

Rand tells him the story, leaving out the worst of the Shadowspawn, and tells him they were hoping to meet their friends here. Rand intends to head for Tar Valon if they do not show up.\nMaster Gill tells them approaching the Aes Sedai advisor of Queen Morgase, Elaida of the Red Ajah, will not be a good idea because of their connection with Thom and he hints at political trouble in the city. Before he can explain he is called away to the kitchen though. Rand and Mat are taken to their room in the attic by one of the maids where Mat lies down on the bed and refuses to get up. He has been suspicious and pessimistic throughout the conversation with Master Gill. Rand goes down to see if he can find the innkeeper alone.\nMaster Gill is nowhere to be found and after spending some time in the common room of the inn, Rand retreats to the privacy of the library. Rand is admiring Master Gill's collection of books when he notices he is not alone. A creature looking like a Trolloc to Rand shares the room with him. Rand panics and reaches for his sword but the creature assures Rand that he is not a Trolloc and introduces himself as Loial. Loial is an Ogier.\nLoial tells him what he is doing in Caemlyn. He left the stedding, the home of Ogier they are tied to in some way, without permission of the Elders to see the world he has read about. Especially the Groves. At ninety years of age he is not allowed to go 'Outside' without their permission. Loial seems to think the world has changed a lot since the books he read were written.\nThe Ogier seems to think that Rand is an Aiel and is surprised to learn Rand is from the Two Rivers - which he knows as Manetheren. Loial asks Rand why he is so far from home. For some reason Rand feels compelled to tell Loial the truth. The whole story this time. After listening carefully the Ogier tells Rand he is ta'veren, a person whose thread the Pattern weaves the threads of other lives around. Maybe his friends are, too. Loial asks permission to travel with Rand. He does not want to miss the opportunity to travel with a ta'veren. Considering the danger he is in Rand politely declines the offer. He still fears for the life of his friends. Loial comforts him and tells him his friends will be alright. Rand is not too sure about that."

One night Byar steps into the tent they are held in, like he has done before to tell them about what awaits them in Amador. This time, however, he offers Perrin escape. Perrin is surprised by this offer--Byar is convinced they are Darkfriends, after all--and he hesitates to accept. Just as Perrin starts to reply he gets a message from Dapple: help is underway. The next moment Perrin sees the guards go down and Lan stepping into the tent. Lan knocks out Byar and starts to untie Egwene and Perrin.\nThe Warder tells them they are not saved yet and that they have to take a white cloak. Perrin takes Byar's even though he can almost smell the man on it. A few moments later lightning starts crashing down around the camp and Lan, Egwene and Perrin leave the tent in search of Moiraine. They meet her just outside the camp. Egwene wants to know where Mat and Rand are, but there is no time to answer that question. Moiraine tells Lan Nynaeve hasn't returned yet. Lan is ready to go looking for her but Moiraine stops him, reminding him, Lord of the Seven Towers, of his oaths. At that moment Nynaeve comes crashing through the bushes with Bela and a second horse. They flee the camp while the Whitecloaks are still confused but not before Egwene finds out Mat and Rand are not with them.\nWhile they move south towards the Caemlyn road Perrin feels Dapple touch his mind once again. She tells him they'll meet again and leaves. Lan circles back a few times to look for signs of pursuit but finds none. Not much short of dawn they halt to rest. Nynaeve tends to the bruises Byar caused Perrin and notices the irises of Perrin's eyes are yellow. She has never seen this before, and she's worried. Moiraine recognizes what it is but won't tell Nynaeve. She only says it won't hurt him directly.\nBefore they go to sleep the Warder tells Perrin that his eyes are not a thing of the Dark One. He wants to know if Perrin met a guide, and Perrin tells him about Elyas. Lan knew Elyas. It turns out he was a Warder before he ran with the wolves. Lan won't say much about him; he only indicates that there was trouble with the Red Ajah. Lan has a great deal of respect for Elyas though and wants to know if he is alright. Perrin tells him he thinks Elyas is okay. Lan observes that Perrin obviously is significant for the weaving of the Pattern in some way and that his choices are probably limited. He thinks it is a good thing Perrin is back under Moiraine's supervision and says that the other two boys should be found soon or all may be lost."

The front of the inn is being watched by the faction that blames the Queen and her Aes Sedai advisor of all wrongs in the city.\nOut on the street the tension is almost tangible. Violence between those supporting the Queen, indicated by the red armbands, cockades or wrappings, and those who oppose her, indicated by the color white, seems only a matter of time. Rand, still wearing his red wrappings, heads in the direction of the Inner City, where he thinks he has the best chance of seeing the Queen and Logain. He joins in with the crowd's song. In the Inner City, Rand runs into the beggar Master Gill was talking about. The beggar yells out and tries to reach Rand. Rand runs off without looking where he's going.\nAfter he shakes off the beggar he finds himself in an unfamiliar part of the Inner City. He tries to find a good spot to watch the false Dragon. Rand hears the drums and trumpets accompanying Logain and the Aes Sedai guarding him. Rand climbs a wall to get a good look. He sees Logain being guarded by four Aes Sedai, all concentrating very hard. He wonders out loud why they do that. A girl's voice replies they are shielding him from the Source. Rand is so surprised he loses his balance and topples off the wall backward. On his way down he hits his head and passes out."

It takes Rand some time to realize he is in the company of Elayne, the daughter-heir of Andor and her brother Gawyn.\nWhile they are talking, Elayne and Gawyn's half brother appears. Galad has come looking for them because they left their quarters to see Logain against the Queens orders. Galad, an extremely handsome man, sees Rand as an intruder. Elayne tells him not to call the guard but Galad does the \"right thing\", as he always does, according to Gawyn, and calls them. Before Elayne and Gawyn can sneak him out of the garden the guard arrives.\nThe guard, led by an officer named Tallanvor, think Rand is a serious threat. Elayne steps between Rand and the guardsmen and claims guest right for Rand. Tallanvor wants to lock Rand up until the Captian-General Gareth Bryne has time to question him. Elayne wants to be led before the Queen and tells Tallanvor she will join Rand in the cell if he intends to proceed. The stale-mate is broken by a messenger summoning them all to appear before Queen Morgase.\nOn their way to the Queen, Rand notices the Gardens are green and flowering despite the weather. Elayne tells him this is the work of Elaida, the Aes Sedai advisor of the Queen. They are led to one of the smaller halls, Gawyn seems to think this is a favorable sign.\nElaida and Lord Gareth are in the presence of the Queen when they are led before her. Morgase begins by lecturing Elayne and Gawyn about their responsibilities and disobeying her orders before she turns her attention to Rand. Elayne requests to speak and tells her mother what happened. She calls Rand a loyal Andorman. The Queen is skeptical. She knows very well the Two Rivers do not consider themselves part of her Realm.\nElaida has a close look at Rand and points out that he doesn't have the look of a Two Rivers man and that he carries a heron marked blade. This doesn't support Rand's claim to be a shepherd. She Foretells that Rand will be at the center of the turmoil the world will face soon. When the Queen asks the Captain-General for his opinion, he councils to keep Rand locked up until Logain and Elayne and Gawyn, who will be traveling to Tar Valon to receive training, are well on their way.\nQueen Morgase, however, feels Caemlyn is becoming too suspicious and wants no part of it. She recognizes Two River speech, both Elaida and Bryne have never heard it, and can't see any evidence Rand means them any harm. She decides Rand should be seen out of the palace unharmed but warns him to be more careful in future. Elayne and Gawyn see him out. Elayne tells him she thinks Rand is handsome and favors him with a dazzling smile. Gawyn seems to think this amusing. Rand asks Gawyn why everybody has a hard time believing he is from the Two Rivers. Gawyn replies Rand looks like an Aiel."

Reluctantly everybody agrees to try the Ways.\nThey spend the rest of the evening planning their trip. Moiraine sends for Master Gill to get them the things they need. It is deep into the night when the company leaves the library in search of a bath and bed.\nAs soon as Rand falls asleep he knows his dream is not a normal dream. Ba'alzamon is in his dreams again. Rand sees three tiny figures, one with a wolf at his feet, one with a dagger and one with a sword. Ba'alzamon tries to tempt him to kneel to him by offering him power beyond imagination and threatens him with eternal pain if he refuses. Ba'alzamon tells him the battle between them is as old as time itself and that he has no change of winning it. Remembering Moiraine's advice, Rand tries to deny Ba'alzamon. He is not impressed and continues pressing Rand. Panicking, Rand destroys the little figures and feels something stab his hand as he does so. Rand tries desperately to wake up, and when he does so he notices Mat wakes up at the same time.\nMat tells him he had the same dream. Rand thinks Ba'alzamon still doesn't know which of the three he is looking for. As he gets up he notices a splinter in his hand. A reminder. As Rand removes it Moiraine comes in telling them it is time to leave."

The Whitecloaks and those opposing the Queen are still watching the Queen's Blessing. Mat tells Rand he has noticed the change in Perrin, but there is no time to discuss it now. Loial can sense the Waygate and leads them through Caemlyn towards it. Just before sunrise they arrive at a building under which Loial says the Waygate is. Using the One Power Moiraine breaks into the cellar. There they find the Waygate. Loial is visibly upset by what happened to the Grove that used to grow there. After Moiraine opens the Waygate the company enters one by one.\nThe Ways are a dark place where time runs differently. The light of the lanterns seem to have trouble penetrating the darkness. It turns out the Ways are a series of Islands connected by bridges, although what holds the bridges up, or the Islands for that matter is a mystery to Rand. Each Island has a Guide, a big slab of stone covered in Ogier script, saying which bridge leads where. All of the Guides and bridges seem damaged, eroded by time, but Loial can still make out which bridge they need to take.\nLoial leads them across a series of bridges consulting a Guide at each Island. The damage to the Guides and bridges seems to vary but Rand questions the stability of most. At midday Lan signals a brief stop to hand out a meal. They eat in the saddle though. Moiraine doesn't want to spend a moment more in the Ways than they have to. The Warder indicates they will not stop before nightfall. After traveling across another series of bridges Rand is beginning to feel that the Ways are not that bad. At that moment though Loial finds the bridge he wants to travel over has collapsed."

Loial is shaken by the fact that the corruption of the Ways has gone this far. He offers to take them to the nearest Waygate but Moiraine insist they go to Fal Dara.\nLoial leads them further until Lan decides it is time to halt for the night. There is no indication of it being night in the Ways but Rand is yawning already. They quickly set up a camp and have dinner and tea. At the talk over dinner it becomes increasingly clear that the all but promised couple Rand and Egwene are heading in different directions. Before they go to sleep Moiraine kneels down with all of them to whisper a few reassuring words. As long as they are close to her their dreams will be safe.\nThe following morning, as far as you could call it that in the Ways, they have a quick breakfast and get ready to be off. Lan tells them someone is following them. That someone doesn't seem interested in catching up though so Moiraine decides to leave it alone. At one of the Islands they find evidence of Trollocs entering the Ways. They left their runes on one of the Guides. Some distance away they find the remains of a group of Trollocs. Their end wasn't pretty. Moiraine thinks it might have been a trap left by the male Aes Sedai who built the Ways to keep Shadowspawn out. Cautiously, they continue on their way.\nLater that day, Rand notices a faint sound of the wind. According to Loial there is no wind in the Ways so Rand asks him about it. Loial turns pale and announces that Machin Shin, the Black Wind that eats souls, is on its way. Moiraine asks him how many more bridges they need to cross. According to Loial only two. They rush towards the Fal Dara Waygate. When they find it Moiraine sees the leaf, the key to open the Waygate is gone. She sees no alternative than to destroy it. The company quickly leaves the Ways while Moiraine tries to hold off\u200b the Black Wind with the One Power. Moiraine steps out last, the Black Wind tries to follow her but can't leave the Ways. Moiraine is shaken by the corruption of the Ways, it even tainted the female half of the One Power.

Loial refuses to stay behind as well. He seems eager to meet the Green Man.\nFal Dara turns out to be a city much smaller than Caemlyn. It is dominated by its defenses. Everything in the city seems designed to hold the Trollocs out. Lan tells them to push back the hoods of their cloaks so the guards can see their faces. It is law in Shienar, Fades have to hide their faces to have a chance to enter the city. The guards and the people in the city seem to recognize Lan. He is repeatedly asked if the Golden Crane will fly again.\nThe city itself is packed with people. Everybody seems to have left the surrounding countryside. In the fort at the center of the city an army is preparing for battle. In the fort they are met by a man named Ingtar. He tells them Lord Agelmar is ready to receive them. He also tells them that Shienar is preparing to ride to Tarwin's Gap to stop the Trolloc hordes. He also asks Lan if the Golden Crane will fly again. Lan tells him Malkier is dead and that they have another mission.\nLord Agelmar seems very pleased to see Moiraine and Lan. He tries repeatedly to convince them to join the army heading for Tarwin's Gap. The situation seems almost desperate. Trolloc raids have been intense this winter in all the Borderlands. All four nations are watching their own borders now. There won't be any reinforcements. Moiraine refuses and explains some of their mission to Lord Agelmar. He offers to Moiraine to send some men along with them into the Blight but again Moiraine refuses.\nLord Agelmar turns out to be a good host, the company has dinner with him and he manages to draw everybody into the conversation. Then Ingtar enters and tells Lord Agelmar a stranger with a Lugarder accent has entered the city. Moiraine immediately suspects who this stranger is and asks to see him. The stranger is brought up and Mat, Perrin and Rand recognize him as the peddler, Fain, and the beggar from Caemlyn. Fains turn out the be mad and clearly a Darkfriend. Moiraine asks Lord Agelmar to take him to a place where he can be interrogated."

Lord Agelmar is talking to the ladies while the Ogier seems lost in his own thoughts. Rand, Perrin and Mat keep quiet as well. Then Egwene asks Lord Agelmar about Lan and the Golden Crane, and why he is called Lord of the Seven Towers.\nLord Agelmar tells them Lan's story. He tells about the nation of Malkier which not fifty years before lay north of Shienar and Arafel and about its royal family. King al'Akir Mandragoran and his brother Lain were as close as brothers could be but Lain's wife Breyan was jealous because Akir was on the throne and not her husband. On a dare by his wife Lain rode into the Blight to lead his lances in an expedition to Shayol Ghul, the seat of the Dark One. Lain and most of his party were slain, weakening Malkier's defences.\nBreyan blamed the King for her husband's death and plotted against him with a man named Cowin Fairheart. They sent Malkier into chaos and civil war. At this point Fairhart, who was a Darkfriend, led the Trolloc hordes into Malkier. The defenseless nation was overrun quickly but not before the King and Queen managed to get their baby son Lan to safety in Shienar. While Lan grew up learning about the Blight and battle in Shienar, what was left of Malkier was gradually swallowed by the Blight. Al'Lan Mandragoran is the last king of Malkier, a king without\u200b a land, engaged in a war he can't win or end.\nAll of this is hard for Nynaeve to swallow but before they have chance to discuss it further Moiraine and Lan join them again. The company is curious about what they learnt from Fain. Moiraine is appalled by the evil in Padan Fain, he is beyond being a Darkfriend. He told her he was summoned to Shayol Ghul as early as three years ago to receive instructions from Ba'alzamon. Since that time he has been hunting for the three boys. It was Fain that found them in the Two Rivers, Fain that lead the Trollocs and Fades to Emond's Field and Fain that brought the Shadowspawn back on their trail after Moiraine set a false trail near Baerlon, all the while he was treated like an animal by the Fades. Fain started to hate the Dark One to the point where he wanted to break free.\nAt Shadar Logoth he finally saw his chance. He fled from his tormentors but soon found he couldn't get rid of the urge to hunt the three boys. He followed them to Caemlyn and even through the Ways to Shienar. Moiraine is still unsure why Machin Shin fled when it found him but the fact alone sends shivers of fear through the company. Lord Agelmar again offers men to accompany them in the Blight and offers shelter for the boys who are inexperienced in his eyes. Moiraine refuses again. She intends to leave for the Blight early the next day."

The landscape gradually changes until it is corrupted beyond recognition. The cold spring of Shienar is replaced by a damp heat. The Blight has its effect on the company.

Rand notices that his drawn parchment face seems less withered than before, as if Aginor has fed well on something.\nThe Forsaken says that the Dark One will give rewards beyond dreaming to the one that brings Rand to Shayol Ghul, but why should he share power and bend knee to Rand? As he talks, Rand feels something and though he knows\u200b there is nothing to see, he sees a glowing rope from Aginor, connecting the Forsaken to something distant beyond knowing. The rope pulses, and with every throb Aginor grows stronger, more fully fleshed. Yet beside the glowing cord, Aginor seemed not to exist.\nA bright finger-strand drifts towards Rand and fills him with heat, building up warmth; the warmth and radiance of light, of the Light. Aginor shouts \"You shall not have it! It is mine!\", and suddenly flames shoot from his mouth and eyes, leaving him screaming.\nThe Light is blinding Rand's mind, stunning him with awe. He stands in a mountain pass, surrounded by the tail end of a battle, and he can see the banners of Fal Dara, Shienar, Dha'vol, Ko'bal and Dhai'mon.\nHe has humans on one side and Shadowspawn on the other, and when a Myrddraal points at him, Draghkar fly down towards him. He feels the heat of the touched sun again and from the clear sky, a lightning bolt strikes each Draghkar. He falls on his knees, screaming, as a wall of fire envelops the Trolloc host, leaving it highly reduced.\nA voice rises, making Rand's skull vibrate, saying that only the chosen one can do what must be done. Steps rise, stretching up into the murk that obscures the sun. The human forces launch their last charge, and seeing as he will get trampled over by the horses, Rand steps on the first step, causing him to be surrounded in darkness. He continues walking, till he reaches a wooden door, and when he enters, he finds himself standing in the chamber from his dream. He finds Ba'alzamon seated in front of the fireplace, and notices that he also has a cord, though his is black. He tells Rand that he only has one choice: to kneel before him, but Rand denies him. Ba'alzamon shows him his mother, who tells him that the Father of Lies is stronger than he once was. As she disappears screaming, Rand finds himself with a sword of light, of the Light.\nBa'alzamon shouts that he cannot wield it so until he has taught him and that Rand will destroy himself, but as Rand cuts the black cord from his back, he hurls into the fireplace, and as Rand's cord thins out, he walks over to Ba'alzamon and flames fill the room. Rand falls through endless black, and is struck with tremendous force, turning him to jelly, screaming from the fire raging inside and the hungry cold burning without end."

He starts shouting that Shai'tan is dead, naming the Dark One because he thinks there is no more need for caution.\nWith some effort, he manages to get on his feet and down the hill, and when he reaches level ground, he starts running. He thinks about Egwene, but can't remember who she is. When he reaches the clearing, he starts shouting for her, and when he finds her with Moiraine and Nynaeve, he starts remembering.\nThey talk about what happened, and the Aes Sedai explains that the two Forsaken probably were trapped near the surface, and that the patch on the Dark One's prison weakened enough to free them. When Rand wants to tell them that he killed Shai'tan, she corrects him and says that they should still call him the Dark One, or at least Ba'alzamon. He then understands that he was wielding the One Power. Moiraine has already told Nynaeve and Egwene, so they are not surprised when he understands, but the Aes Sedai makes him tell her everything that happened in detail.\nThe others return from the cavern with a large gold chest ornate with silver, a big bundle of folded cloth and fragments of pottery. When they see Rand, they tell him how good it is to see him alive and that the women stopped them from looking for him.\nWhen Mat asks how come the things they found in the Eye weren't destroyed, Moiraine tells him that they weren't put there to be destroyed, and takes the pottery pieces from Mat. She puts it together into a perfect circle, with the ancient symbol of the Aes Sedai: the Flame of Tar Valon, joined with the Dragon's Fang. She gives Lan a knife, and he picks the largest fragment and brings the knife down with full force. There is not a mark on the piece, and the Aes Sedai says that it is cuendillar, heartstone, and that once made, nothing can break it. When Mat wonders how the piece was shattered, she tells him that it is one of the seals on the Dark One's prison.\nMoiraine then opens the gold chest, and inside there is a curled, gold horn. It only has a line of silver script inlaid around the mouth of the bell, and the Aes Sedai says that it must be carried to Illian. Moiraine hands the horn to Loial who can read the Old Tongue, and the Ogier reads out loud: Tia mi aven Moridin isainde vadin, the grave is no bar to my call. Lan appears shaken and there's a touch of awe in his voice as he says it is the Horn of Valere.\nThe Aes Sedai wonders whether the Eye of the World was made for the use they put it or to guard the items. She then asks for the cloth, and Perrin gives it to Lan and Loial who unfold it and hold it up. It is the banner used by Lews Therin Telamon, the banner of the Dragon.\nMoiraine says that they will rest and sleep before going on. With the Green Man gone, there is no one to hold the place away from the Blight, and Rand sees that dead leaves are falling from the trees already. When he asks the Aes Sedai if it's done, she tells him that what they came to do is finished, and that he from now may live his life as the Pattern weaves."

The cool breezes have been replaced by a sticky heat, but a thin circle of grass and flowers have centered on the thick trunk above the Green Man's grave. Mounted, the party is ready to move on, but Loial says that it is not right that Treebrother should fall to the Blight. He walks over to the tree and starts singing in a rumbling voice as if the earth sings. When he is done, the leaves on the oak seem greener, and the flowers circling it stand straighter.\nThey then ride out into the Blight, and though Rand half expects their group to be attacked like they were on the way in, nothing moves or attacks them. Lan chooses a campsite just before sunset, and the next morning the Blight fades as they come further south. Twisted trees are replaced by straight, and slowly the forest around them becomes red with new growth, and it is as if spring now had raced to catch up to where it should be.\nWhen they reach the border, men come out of the watchtowers to greet them, laughing with joy as if they can not believe the new grass under their feet. They tell about a great victory for the Light in Tarwin's Gap. They reach Fal Dara in the afternoon where the soldiers newly come to Fal Dara celebrate the victory and the spring. When they meet Ingtar, he is the only one not happy as he came an hour too late to see. Moiraine insists on them being brought to Lord Agelmar. When they meet him, he tells them that the men says the Light took on flesh and fought for them, and that the Creator walked in the Gap, but that he only saw a man, and what he did cannot be. The Aes Sedai replies to him that the Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills. After making sure Padan Fain is secure, she shows him the Horn of Valere, but refuses him to use it to march to the Blasted Lands and level Shayol Ghul, but asks of an escort for it to Illian where it belongs.\nSeven days later, Rand finishes his sword practice with Lan in Agelmar's private garden and meets Egwene. He tells her that he will go away, and when she asks him if he'll be going home, he tells her that he'll never go home."

The faint glow fades away from the stone, and though the stone in itself has no power, the first use she had learned of the One Power, was to use the stone to listen to people when they thought they were too far off to be overheard. Smiling, she whispers that the Prophecies will be fulfilled and that the Dragon is Reborn."
