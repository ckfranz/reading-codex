Bukama, his friend and teacher, soon joins him, and the two of them speak about the Aiel War that they are participating in. \nAs they walk, one of the sentries leads a nameless Tairen officer to them. The officer is there on behalf of one Lord Emares, who wishes to form an anvil and hammer to attack a group of five or six hundred Aiel. Lan agrees and sends Bukama off to awaken the men. \nThey set off, and soon they reach the Hook, a treeless crest that is less than forty feet high and a mile long that doubles back from the north to the south. It is here that Lan and his men will form the anvil. Lan finds himself hoping that the Aiel do not simply choose a spot and use their bows, since in this way he will lose a lot of men. \nWhen the Aiel appear, Lan sees that there are easily two thousand of them. Lan decides to stay where he is, because if Emares strikes without the anvil in place, the Tairens will be crushed. However, if Emares does not show up by the time the Aiel are within two hundred paces of Lan's men, he will get his men to try to ride around the Aiel warriors to join Emares. \nAt five hundred paces, the Aiel come to a stop. Raising their spears, they shout \"Aan'allein!\" which means \"One Man Alone\" in the Old Tongue. Lan and his men are all confused, even more so when the Aiel warriors veer to the east, not attacking them. Lan decides not to follow, but instead wishes to speak with Emares.\n",

As Moiraine waits in the cold office, she thinks about the Aiel War, about the two Aes Sedai in the room, about why they seemed to be worried, and about her closest friend, Siuan. As she thinks specifically about how Gitara has the Talent of Foretelling, she wishes that she could be present during one of Gitara's Foretellings. \nSuddenly, outside, trumpets begin to blare. Tamra sends Moiraine to see if there is a message from the battlefield, and tells Siuan to make some tea. Moiraine exits the room into the anteroom, and speaks to Elin Warrel, the novice on duty. There have been no messages. When Moiraine returns, she joins Siuan where the other girl is preparing the tea, and takes a cup to Gitara. When Tamra sees her, she asks if there is any news. Before Moiraine can reply, Gitara jumps to her feet, her eyes wide with terror. \n\"He is born again!\" she says. \"I feel him! The Dragon takes his first breath on the slope of Dragonmount! He is coming! He is coming! Light help us! Light help the world! He lies in the snow and cries like the thunder! He burns like the sun!\" As she finishes speaking, Gitara falls forward into Moiraine's arms. Tamra is there in an instant, using the One Power to Delve and find out what is wrong with Gitara; she is dead. \nTamra orders horrified Moiraine and Siuan not to tell anyone that Gitara has just Foretold the birth of the Dragon Reborn, though she does not mention the word \"Dragon\". She then orders for Elin to be sent in to her, so that Tamra can tell her where to find Gitara's serving woman. \nAs Moiraine and Siuan leave the room, Moiraine thinks to herself, \"I wished to hear a Foretelling, and what I received was a Foretelling of doom.\"\n",

In Siuan's room, they begin to practice for the Aes Sedai test, with Siuan attempting to make Moiraine lose her concentration. After a little while, Myrelle enters the room and joins in their practicing. Together, Siuan and Myrelle do a good job of distracting Moiraine. \nTarna Feir, another Accepted, arrives and tells the three other girls that the Amyrlin Seat has summoned the Accepted to the Oval Lecture Hall, and also tells them that Gitara died. \nWhen the four of them reach the Lecture Hall, all of the other Accepted are already there, all of them gossiping about why Tamra wishes to speak to them. One girl thinks that they are all to be tested immediately for the shawl, while another thinks that Gitara had a Foretelling about the end of the White Tower, so they are all going to be sent home. \nWhen Tamra enters the room, she puts all of these rumors to rest. She announces to them all that, in thanksgiving for the continued safety of Tar Valon, the Tower will be awarding each woman in the city and surrounding area who has recently had a child with one hundred crowns. As there are no available Aes Sedai around, she is sending them into the camps nearest to the city to record information on each child that has been born. Each Accepted will be accompanied by four guards. She warns them to be careful, as there are Whitecloaks with the army. \nAs the Accepted leave, Moiraine and Siuan are both very excited.

The city is alive and very noisy, as if there hadn't been a battle outside the walls. Moiraine even sees some Ogier stonemasons repairing buildings. \nFinally, they reach the Alindaer Gate and proceed to exit the city. As they begin to ride across the bridge, they see a group of nine or ten Whitecloaks at the foot of the bridge. They sit for a moment, and then turn and ride away. \nOnce off the bridge, Siuan attempts to make Steler take them to the farthest camps, the ones that just happen to be the nearest to Dragonmount, but he refuses.

At first, women seethe around them in a very disorderly manner, until Siuan weaves Air and Fire to enhance her voice and orders them to be quiet. There are women from all stations in life, from noblewomen to farmers' wives. One of the women, Susa Wynn, has a child that is too old to have been born recently, but Moiraine writes her name down anyway. Susa is very thin and most likely starving, and her child is sick. Feeling sympathy for the woman, Moiraine gives her money so that she can take her son to a Wise Woman. \nSome time later, once noon has passed and Moiraine and Siuan have eaten, two Aes Sedai, Meilyn and Elaida, show up, effectively ruining the camp's belief that Moiraine and Siuan are Aes Sedai. Meilyn reminds them to be back at the Tower before dark, and then she and Elaida leave. \nThe women waiting in line are now not nearly as respectful as they had been earlier, and several times Moiraine and Siuan have to shout and threaten. When they get down to about a dozen women, Steler tells them that it is time to leave. Women from the camp hold him and the other guards back while Moiraine and Siuan quickly finish. \nThey manage to get back to the Tower before sunset. In the Accepted's quarters, Katerine Alruddin, another Accepted, is waiting for them, and tells Moiraine that Merean, the Mistress of Novices, wishes to see her. When Moiraine arrives at Merean's study, she is told that three of her uncles, King Laman and two of his brothers, were killed that day. Merean also says that because of this, Moiraine does not have to go out the next day. Moiraine argues that if she stays behind, she will be alone, but Merean is still doubtful. Upon returning to her room, Moiraine skips supper and instead prays for her uncles' souls. \nThat night, she has nightmares about the Dragon Reborn. She ends up spending the rest of the night in Siuan's room. \n",

They quickly get ready to leave. \nMerean appears and announces to Moiraine that the Amyrlin agrees that Moiraine should stay behind today. So that her mind isn't left unoccupied, she will be put to work copying out the messier lists of names. When Siuan agrees that Moiraine should stay behind, Merean tells her that she can keep Moiraine company. Siuan tells Moiraine that this way they get to look at all of the lists, and that maybe they can find the Dragon Reborn. The two of them eat breakfast and then get to work. Moiraine is worried since a lot of the information is very vague, such as \"born within sight of Tar Valon's walls.\" \nThe next morning, Moiraine and Siuan continue their work, though no one said that they had to. Shortly after, two clerks walk in, and the elder remarks that she dislikes \"being set a task only to learn someone else is already performing it.\" They leave, and minutes later, Tamra appears. She tells them that they may continue if they wish. \nAbout an hour later, Moiraine comes across a likely entry, and writes it down on a separate piece of paper for later use. Siuan is also writing likely names down in a small book. \nShortly after midmorning, one of the Gray Sitters, Jarna Malari, appears and tells Moiraine to come walk with her. Jarna questions Moiraine about who she thinks will become the next king or queen of Cairhien. \nThroughout the day, six more Sitters, one from each Ajah, each speak with Moiraine. Tsutama, one of the Red Sitters, asks outright if Moiraine has ever thought of being queen of Cairhien herself. This just gives Moiraine more nightmares. \nWhereas before, Moiraine had not thought herself ready to be tested for Aes Sedai, she now wants to be tested as soon as possible. She decides that she will leave the Tower as soon as she is raised to Aes Sedai, until the whole Cairhien issue has blown over. \n",

                    "Summary": "Lews Therin Telamon wanders through a palace filled with dead bodies lying everywhere. The palace is smeared in soot and has scorch-marks on the walls, floors and ceiling as a result of the lighting and fires, which killed many. It had once been pretty, with bright murals, colorful tapestries and paintings and finely carved furnishing inlaid with ivory and gold. \nLews Therin calls for his wife,  Ilyena without noticing the dead people on the floor. He's wearing what was once a fine cloak, on which is embroidered a circle half white and half black, the colors separated by a sinuous line. When he sees it in a mirror, he remembers that it meant something, but he can't remember what. \nThe air behind him ripples and shimmers, solidifying a black-clad man who calls Lews Therin 'Lord of the Morning' and says that he has come for him. \nLews Therin asks if he has the Voice, as it will soon be time for the Singing. He then calls for Ilyena to meet the guest, something that makes the man wonder if \"the taint already has you so far in its grip\". \nThe man tries to make him remember more, when Lews Therin recognizes the name Shai'tan as a dangerous one that is better left unspoken, but the man says that it isn't dangerous for him. \nWhen Lews Therin asks him who he is and what he wants, he presents himself as Elan Morin Tedronai, the Betrayer of Hope. That's what men named him just as Lews Therin was named the Dragon, but from now on people would call Lews Therin Kinslayer. \nAs Lews Therin again calls down the ruined hall for Ilyena, Elan Morin says that Lews Therin once stood first among the Servants, wore the ring of Tamyrlin, sat in the High Seat, summoned the Nine Rods of Dominion and once defeated him at the Gates of Paaran Disen. He then says that that he himself was never very skilled at Healing and that he follows a different power now. He then Heals Lews Therin, who screams of the pain while he staggers around. After some time the pain recedes, and he recognizes Ilyena, a golden-haired woman lying among the dead on the floor. \nElan Morin tries to make him serve the Great Lord of the Dark and says that he can make Ilyena live again. Lews Therin says that he will destroy Elan Morin for Ilyena's death, but he responds by reminding him on his futile attack made by him and his Hundred Companions, who tear the world apart as they talk, on the Great Lord. \nLews Therin looks around and sees faces he loved all slain by him. He then reaches out for the tainted saidin and Travels to a flat and empty landscape where he draws deeply of the Source as he remembers how he had believed in his pride, and while he shouts for forgiveness, a bolt of lightning and fire strikes from the heaven and through Lews Therin, making the earth heave while molten rock fountains high up in the air. When the earth's trembling has finished, Lews Therin is gone and where he stood is now a tall mountain. \nElan Morin appears at the mountain where he promises that it won't end that easily for the Dragon.\n",
                    "Outline": "Lews Therin, after being confronted by Elan Morin, realizes he killed his friends and family while in the throes of madness. In his grief, he departs from the scene of the kinslaying and draws deeply on the One Power, killing himself, and raising Dragonmount.\n"

                    "Summary": "A nine year old Egwene al'Vere is filling her bucket with water from the Winespring. Today is the day the sheep are sheared on a field just outside Emond's Field. Her job is to carry water to the men and women at work and she takes it very seriously. While filling the bucket she notices a raven nearby. The raven behaves strangely; it seems to be watching the men. Could this raven be the Dark One's eyes?\nKenley Ahan, a boy two years her senior, tells her she can't play with the children this year. Kenley will be allowed to help the older boys next year and he seems to think that gives him some kind of authority. Egwene gives him the level look she's seen the older girls and women use on the boys and men, but it doesn't seem to work very well. Egwene decides that she needs to work on that.\nMaking her way through the crowd she hands out water to anyone who asks for it. There are only five days a year when so many people gather in Emond's Field. At Shearing, the day the merchants come to buy wool, the day the merchants come to buy tabac, Sunday and Foolday. Egwene tries to avoid her four sisters in the crowd. They all seem to think she is a baby and usually treat her accordingly. She also tries to keep away from the big sheepdogs. Not that they would harm her but she doesn't really care for them anyway.\nOn her way back to refill her bucket, she passes the row of trestle tables. She spots Kenley again trying to steal a honey cake from one of the tables. He doesn't get far though, Corin Ayellin catches him quickly. Whatever authority he thought he had over Egwene is now gone.\nAs she moves away from the tables she spots the village smith Master Luhhan talking to Joslyn and Con Aybara. Their son Perrin is with them, looking shy and blushing. She doesn't quite understand what they were discussing but it involved Perrin. She notices she is not the only one watching Perrin. Cilia Cole, a girl a few years older than Egwene is looking at him too. Egwene grimaces at the sight of Cilia making big eyes at Perrin. Then she spots the raven behind Cilia. And it is not the only one, they seem to be everywhere today...\nPerrin's sister Adora asks her why she is staring at Perrin. Egwene is startled by her and she doesn't like the way Adora suggests that she was looking at Perrin in that way. She makes a nasty comment and looks for Perrin again to follow him. Unfortunately he's gone. There is nothing to it but go back to the river to refill her bucket.\nWhen she has refilled the bucket she comes across Mistress Barran, the village Wisdom, with her apprentice, the recently orphaned Nynaeve al'Meara. They are tending a wound Bili Congar inflicted on himself with a pair of wool shears. Behind them Egwene sees dozens and dozens of ravens. None of them are trying to take any food, they are just watching. It looks unnatural to Egwene. Before she can ask the Wisdom about it though, Nynaeve asks her if she doesn't have work to do. Nynaeve is with her back to Egwene, yet she always seems to know when she is there. The only thing she can do is get back to work. Her day doesn't get any better when she overhears her sister Elisa and some other women talking about why her hair isn't braided yet. Elisa takes her frustration out on Egwene.\nAfter she has refilled the bucket again she starts looking for Perrin or Mat. It takes her a while to find the boys. When she finds them, Egwene sneaks up to overhear their conversation. Mat and Perrin are in the company of a few other boys, Rand al'Thor among them. Rand is the boy everybody says she will marry later. Egwene wonders if he will make a good husband, and what, for that matter, a good husband is.\nThe boys talk about their future; most of them expect to follow in their father's footsteps. A few of them dream of seeing something of the world first though. Egwene vows that she will see some of the lands Jain Farstrider describes in her favourite book. Not a lot of people leave the Two Rivers but she would. The boys get ready to get back to work again so it is time for Egwene to leave. When she is about to leave Dannil Lewin passes her hiding place and tells the boys the Mayor wants them. She decides to follow them to see why her father wants to talk to them.\nThe Mayor tells the boys they have worked hard today and that he will reward them with a story. Of course the boys want a story about Trollocs and false Dragons. Bran al'Vere doesn't know any stories about that so he asks Tam al'Thor to do the story telling. Tam decides to tell them the story about how the real Dragon led the Hundred Companions to Shayol Ghul to sealed the bore into the Dark One's prison. Cenn Buie, the thatcher, says that isn't a story decent folk should listen to but all the other men seem to approve so Tam tells it anyway. When Tam is done telling Perrin wants to know what a dragon is in the first place. Tam doesn't know the answer to that.\nThe boys get sent back to work after Tam is done telling his tale. Egwene gets ready to follow them but she suddenly becomes aware of someone watching her. Again she notices the ravens. This time they are not only looking at the boys and men. One of them is looking at her. Determined not to be distracted by silly thoughts Egwene gets on with trying to be the best water carrier ever.\nEgwene had to carry water again next year to her disappointment but the year after she got to help with the food. She set herself a new goal then. To be the youngest girl to get her hair braided ever. It wouldn't be easy but easy goals are not really goals at all. She didn't listen to any more stories though, but she still liked to read of distant lands.\n",

The winter has been bad, with wolves and bears hunting in the Two Rivers. Tam and Rand are transporting apple brandy and apple cider to the Winespring Inn for use during Bel Tine. As they walk, Rand gets a feeling that he's being watched and tries to shrug it off. But as the feeling grows stronger, he looks over his shoulder, and sees a black-clad, cloaked figure on a black horse. \nThe rider is totally covered in his cloak so that no part of him is showing. When he looks at him, Rand feels that the rider hates everything that's alive, but him above all things. He stumbles, and Tam asks him what's wrong, but when they look down the road again, it is empty. Tam reminds him of the flame and the void, a thing he has taught Rand. He should concentrate on one flame and feed all of his passions in it until his mind became empty, and focus on the void. \nThey finally arrive in Emond's Field, where things are being done ready for Bel Tine. Wit Congar stops them and asks Tam what to do with the village's Wisdom, Nynaeve al'Meara. The Congars and Coplins are well known for being complainers and troublemakers. He is stopped by his wife, Daise Congar, who tells him not to meddle in Women's Circle business. As they continue, they walk past the Green, where older women are erecting the Spring Pole. When they reach the Winespring Inn, Bran al'Vere, innkeeper and the Mayor, greets them. Cenn Buie appears and the three men start talking about the Wisdom. \nMat Cauthon hides behind the cart so only Rand can see him, and they start talking. Mat mentions that he and a friend caught a badger and plan to set it loose to wreak havoc at the upcoming festivities. Rand finds out that Mat also has seen the stranger on the horse and while they discuss him, Tam spots Mat and gets him to help Rand with unloading the cider. He tells them that a gleeman has arrived in the village to entertain at Bel Tine, something that cheers the boys up after talking about the rider.\n",

With this comment everybody gasps and starts shouting that it can only be another false Dragon. Fain says that they cannot be sure whether he is the Dragon Reborn or just a false Dragon, but that this one can channel the One Power and that a party of Aes Sedai has ridden south from Tar Valon to deal with him.\nThe Village Council brings the peddler to the inn to discuss the issue more thoroughly. Mat, Perrin and Rand start discussing the news and tales about the Dragon and Aes Sedai. Mat has just told the others that Bili Congar named the Dark One last year when Nynaeve comes to them and tells Mat that he \"shouldn't be off his mother's apron strings\".

                    "Summary": "Rand takes Moiraine and Lan to Tam's room and the Aes Sedai begins looking Tam over. Thom not wanting to be near or have anything to do with Aes Sedai leaves the room and Lan says he doesn't like the gleeman, he doesn't trust him and saw nothing of him during the attack the night before. Master al'Vere mentions that Thom was there and didn't get his cloak singed sitting in front of the fireplace.\nRand doesn't care what the gleeman did and pleads to stay near his father when Moiraine tells everyone to leave. Moiraine impatiently agrees to let Rand remain and says he may talk, but to do so quietly.\nMoiraine begins using the One Power to ease Tam's breathing while Lan and Rand speak in quiet tones. Lan remarks about the sword Rand is carrying, saying how strange it is to see a sheepherder with one. He asks Rand if it by chance has any herons on it, to which Rand replies it does, however Rand is more concerned with what Moiraine is doing. Lan comments that he didn't think to find a heron-mark sword in a place like the Two Rivers and Rand tells him it's Tam's sword, that he'd bought it a long time ago.\nRand watches Moiraine and Tam while talking quietly with the Warder, he says Tam never had any use for the sword, until last night. Lan goes on to tell Rand that in some lands the heron is the symbol of a master swordsman and Tam must not always have thought it was useless.\nRand asks about the night before, about what the mayor told him they (Moiraine and Lan) had done. He asks the Warder if they could have done something differently if they had known about the black cloaked rider sooner. Moiraine jumps into the conversation saying even then they couldn't have done much more without half a dozen of her sisters. She says that by herself, a month's warning wouldn't have made much difference, that there was an entire fist of Trollocs, well over one hundred around the district and that one person can only do so much, even with the One Power.\nMoiraine says that she'll not have Rand thinking he is to blame, that the raven they saw the day before should've warned her, but she was too overconfident. Rand is confused about the raven and Lan explains that they are often used as spies for the Dark One as are rats and crows.\nMoiraine then explains that Tam's wound came from a tainted blade forged in the valley of Thakan'dar on the slopes of Shayol Ghul. The wound will not heal unaided and if left alone will grow again and consume Tam.\nMoiraine uses an angreal carved out of ivory and in the shape of a woman in flowing robes to aid in Healing Tam. Once Moiraine finishes Healing Tam, she joins Lan and Rand's talk. They explain to Rand about the attack and tell him he has to leave the Two Rivers if he wants to protect it.\nThe Trollocs had a purpose in their attack, to kill or capture young men Rand's age, which includes Perrin and Mat. The Myrddraal was after them and nobody else. Rand doesn't understand why and Moiraine tells him his answers cannot be found in The Two Rivers and that there is something about one or all of them that the Dark One fears. Rand can't believe what he's hearing. They tell him the Myrddraal and Trollocs will be back and Rand begins to understand why he has to leave. Moiraine tells Rand that Tar Valon is a place of safety and he can find the answers to his questions there.\nMoiraine and Lan plan to leave after full dark and in secret. The Aes Sedai and Warder then depart to find Perrin and Mat.\n",

A spiking black mountain appears and a voice calling \"Serve me\" follows him. Rand throws himself over an edge not wanting to face the Dark One.\nRand's dream changes and he's looking at Tar Valon, before being chased and falling again. He's then on one of the bridges leading into the city and people are gesturing him towards the Tower. Rand tries going other ways, but the Tower is always straight ahead. The crowd leads him on to the Tower and he goes in to find a Myrddraal waiting for him.\nRand awakens suddenly and finds it's twilight. Going to Tam, Rand discovers his father is awake now, yet weak. Rand tells Tam most of what happened, though leaves out Tam's fever dreams and the question he's afraid to ask, is Tam his father?\nRand tells Tam what Moiraine said about having to leave the Two Rivers. Tam says that Aes Sedai are tricksome, that while they do tell the truth, it is often not what you think it is and he should take care around Moiraine. Tam wants to leave with them except that he needs time to recover.\nLan shows up with a warning that they may have trouble. Tam and Rand make quick goodbyes and Tam tells Rand to keep the sword.\nRand, Mat and Lan watch from inside the Inn as a crowd of village men face Moiraine, telling her to leave Emond's Field and blaming her for the Trolloc attack. Mayor al'Vere and Master Luhhan come to break up the crowd.\nMoiraine, angered by the crowd, tells them their history, that of Manetheren. She tells them of King Aemon and Queen Eldrene, 'bravery, beauty, wisdom and love that death could not sunder.' The Red Eagle banner of Manetheren was at the head of every battle that raged during the Trolloc Wars.\nA Trolloc army moved against the home of Manetheren while its soldiers were away on the Field of Bekkar. The men of Manetheren marched home as if their feet had wings and when the armies of the Dark One reached their lands, the men of Manetheren were waiting for them.\nAemon sent word for help and was promised aid if they could hold three days. The men of Manetheren held back the Trolloc hoards for ten days, aid never came and they could no longer hold back the Dark One's armies. Aemon then sent word throughout his land for his people to flee and find safety.\nIt first came in a trickle then a river and a flood, the people of Manetheren did not flee, rather came to defend their home.\nThe time came when the people of Manetheren were surrounded in what would one day become Emond's Field, no man or woman who stood beneath the Red Eagle banner that day lived to see the night. Manetheren, called 'The sword that could not be broken' was shattered.\nEldrene, alone in the city of Manetheren, felt her husband Aemon die and was filled with vengeance for her love, her people and her land. In her grief Eldrene drew on the True Source and hurled the One Power at the army of Trollocs. The Dreadlords died wherever they were and the Dark One's victorious army fled.\nThe Trollocs were hunted down by other armies in other lands, none of those who murdered the people of Manetheren at Aemon's Field lived.\nDrawing on too much of the One Power, Eldrene died as the Dreadlords did, she and Manetheren were both consumed by fire. The people paid for their land with blood and were bound to it.\n",

While Lan examines the horses, the youths talk about the weapons they have: Rand's sword, Perrin's axe and Mat's bow.\nRand tells them that he talked to Tam about the journey when Moiraine enters the stables. She gives Rand a sharp look, but says, \"what is done is already woven in the Pattern\".\nWhen Lan suggests that they leave immediately, Egwene walks in and says that they won't leave without her. She had spotted Mat and Perrin sneaking around like \"bull calves pretending to be foxes\" and when she put that together with Lan buying more horses, she could only see one answer. When the boys try to get her to change her mind and remind her about the trollocs, she asks them to spare her those \"nonsensical tales\". Moiraine decides that she may come with them, and after a discussion with Lan, he agrees as well. The Warder tells her that she can \"ride the gleeman's horse\", when suddenly Thom's voice comes from the hayloft saying that it \"will not be possible\". They let him come with them after some discussion with him.\nWhen they've mounted their horses, the Warder talks about how much better it would be if there were wolves there. The villagers are shocked and wonder how he can want wolves, so he explains that wolves don't like trollocs and trollocs don't like wolves. Therefore they could be sure that there were no trollocs waiting for them if they'd heard wolves.\nThey ride out of the stables, but when they're just about to leave the stable yard, Lan stops them.\nThey see the Watch patrolling - a dozen men from the village and the surrounding farms, armed with spears and wood axes, some armored with helmets or pieces of armour that had lain in attics for generations.\nAfter they've passed, Lan remarks that two Dha'vol trollocs would have them all for breakfast, but at least they have eyes and ears. The party rides over the Winespring Water onto the far bank, and stops from time to time at Lan's signal, each time a patrol passes.\nWhen they're on the North Road and out of the village, Rand suddenly stops and looks at a creature as big as a man with wings like a bat. Lan tells them that it's a Draghkar, and Moiraine says that if the Trollocs have a Draghkar at their command they will soon know where they are.\nThe villagers asks what a Draghkar is, and Thom explains that \"in the war that ended the Age of Legends, worse than Trollocs and Halfmen were created\". Before they get a chance to ask him more questions, Lan tells them that they shall continue down the North Road and follow his lead \"for their lives\"\n",

They pass some farmhouses on their way, but they quickly leave them behind.\nEventually, the Warder slows down and stops. When they dismount, Rand spots some lights ahead of them, and is shocked when he realises that they've reached Watch Hill that fast.\nThe villagers and Thom say that they should stop for the night at Watch Hill and celebrate Bel Tine, at Watch Hill, there had been no Trollocs, but Lan says that they cannot stop until they're across the Taren. When they protest and say that the horses need rest, they realise that Moiraine is Healing the horses.\nMoiraine remarks that Bela is the least weary of all the horses, and suddenly they hear the Draghkar's scream. It sounds like \"a man dying under sharp knives\". The horses panic, and when the Draghkar shrieks again, Lan commands them to mount the horses fast, as it would not have showed itself unless it already had reported to the Myrddraal.\nThey gallop fast, pursued by the Draghkar's cries. Fog envelops the riders, vanishes and comes again, before they suddenly ride into a \"wall of pale gray\". Moiraine says that she will use the Myrddraal's own slyness against it. As they ride through the thick fog, the shrieks that had hounded them fade, and eventually stop.\nAfter some hours of riding, Lan stops them again. Rand sees some strangely tall houses around him; they had reached the Taren Ferry. They continue deeper into the village, before stopping in front of a tall, dark house that looked the same as the others in the village. Lan hammers his fist at the door, and tells the man who opens, Master Hightower, that they want to cross over on his ferry. He replies that they can come back when the sun is up and the fog is gone, but changes his mind when the Warder gives him some gold coins, promising the same amount when they're over.\n",

They arrive at the ferry landing, where Lan gets Perrin and Rand to throw their cloaks back, so that their weapons, the axe and the sword, are exposed.\nShortly\u200b after, Master Hightower comes down to the landing, accompanied by six men. Rand and Lan put their hands on their sword hilts, Mat, a hand on his quiver, Perrin eases his axe in its leather loop and Thom starts trimming his fingernails with a dagger. These actions seem to make Master Hightower nervous, and he quickly points out that the gold he got is now safely hidden.\nThey then enter the ferry, \"a wooden barge with high sides, boarded by a ramp,\" and as soon as they've gathered in the center of the ferry, they start crossing the River Taren.\nWhen Rand quietly asks Lan whether they would've tried to rob them, the Warder replies \"when what they do is hidden, men sometimes deal with strangers in ways they wouldn't if there were other eyes to see.\"\nAfter a journey in silence, they arrive on the other side, where Master Hightower gets his gold, and the haulers a silver mark each for \"the quick crossing\". As he eyes Lan's purse greedily, the ferry suddenly gets loose with a loud creak. It's taken in a whirlpool, and Lan gives Master Hightower some more gold, before he and his haulers start trotting up the riverside.\nWhen Thom asks why Moiraine doesn't cover them with fog on this side of the river as the Draghkar can easily see them where they are, she tells him that Draghkar are not very smart, and that the Myrddraal probably will have to divide his efforts to find them. Mat asks awkwardly about the ferry, and she explains that she intends\u200b to get them safely to Tar Valon.\nThey then walk up the riverbank and into the woods where they stop at a dried-up watercourse, hidden under a heap of trees. Lan tells them that he expected them to stop there, as it \"seemed a likely place\". He then goes to check the horses.\nMoiraine asks Egwene if they can talk, and they crawl into a pile of tree trunks to talk for themselves.\nLan hands the others feedbags and some oats for the horses. When Perrin remarks that it doesn't look like they need any rest, the Warder tells them that they can run at their fastest until the second they drop dead by exhaustion they never even felt.\nThey can hear the Draghkar's shrieks, but according to Lan, it's just searching the river for them.\nThe rest of the party then crawls into the opening Egwene and Moiraine had gone into, where they find a cave with a roof of tree trunks and branches. Moiraine and Egwene sit on the other side of a fire, Moiraine talking about the One Power. She tells Egwene that she is one of the handful who don't have to learn to use the One Power as she is born with it, and will eventually start to channel.\nShe holds up a blue stone and guides Egwene in her first attempt to channel light into it, and she manages to produce a small flicker all by her own. Moiraine tells her that she has accomplished something most women who come to the Tower take months to learn, and that she one day even may become the Amyrlin Seat. She cries out in delight and tells Rand that she will be an Aes Sedai.\n",

Lan also spends time teaching Rand, Mat and Perrin how to use their weapons. Each of the boys do quite well with a bow, and then Lan teaches Rand how to use his sword and Perrin his axe.\nRand watches Egwene unbraid her hair one morning and asks her why she did that. Egwene tells him that she'll be Aes Sedai and that they don't braid their hair unless they want to. Rand and Egwene argue for a bit until Lan speaks up reminding them they need to be quiet.\nMat begins thinking that they've lost the Trollocs for good and wants to explore the world. Moiraine and Egwene return from one of their talks just then and Moiraine asks if they've already forgotten Winternight. She tells them again that the Dark One is after one or all of them and that she will destroy them herself before she allows the Dark One to have them.\nRand is bothered by Moiraine and Egwene going off to speak alone each night, so after everyone else settles down one night, he sneaks off to find out what they're doing. They speak a bit of the Five Powers. Egwene wants to be reassured that female Aes Sedai are not evil, that it was the men who broke the world. Moiraine tells her that the men who broke the world were not evil, they were insane. Moiraine also tells her that Aes Sedai are still human, that in Tar Valon, she'll meet both kind and cruel Aes Sedai, brave and cowardly, strong and weak. Egwene asks why the Trollocs came to Emond's Field and Moiraine swings her head to the tree Rand is hiding behind. Rand backs away into the shadows and scurries away as quietly as he can.\nThey travel on and atop a low hill spot Baerlon. Moiraine tells them they must be careful what they say and they must attract as little attention as possible. She also says that her and Lan go by different names here. She is known as Alys and Lan is known as Andra.\nLan leads them down the hill and through some woods to heavy wooden gates. The gatekeeper nearly tells them to try another gate until he sees Moiraine. The gatekeeper, Avin, says he didn't know it was them and opens the gate.\nMoiraine and Lan speak with Avin, he tells them that Whitecloaks are in the city and though they haven't caused much trouble, nobody wants them there. He also mentions a man in Ghealdan claiming to be The Dragon with an army moving towards Tear and that Aes Sedai were sent to Ghealdan, though some or all are said to be dead.\nMoiraine leads them off and Rand asks Thom about the rumors Avin spoke of. Thom tells Rand a bit of the Karaethon Cycle. Of the Stone of Tear, and if it falls it'll be one of the major proofs that the Dragon is reborn. The prophecies don't make much sense to Rand and Thom tells him that they wouldn't be much for prophecies if they were easy to fulfill.\nThey arrive at the Stag and Lion through a back gate into the stables.

Mat nearly tells him about Trollocs in the Two Rivers except for Rand, Perrin and Thom putting in words just in time to stop him. Lan shows up in the baths, sends Ara away and lectures the boys again about what they say.\nAfter the baths, Rand spots a girl in mens clothing and short hair with Moiraine. She looks at them sharply, nods to Moiraine and then hurries away.\nThey then settle down for some dinner in a private dinning room. They listen to Lan speak of the rumors people are saying around town. Of the false Dragon Logain being the victor in Ghealdan. He says there are no strangers that could be Myrddraal and certainly no Trollocs. Also that Whitecloaks are in town and trying to make things difficult for the Governor. Moiraine suggests that they remain in Baerlon a couple days and Lan agrees so long as they remember what he told them.\nReturning to his room, Rand drifts to sleep. Rand finds himself in a shadowy stone hallway with doors spaced at regular intervals. He walks down the unchanging hallway for a long time before opening one of the doors into a grim, stone walled chamber. Rand finds a man in dark clothing with a mouth and eyes of flame.

He doesn't feel good about leaving Perrin behind and thinks that Thom may finish his performance, then he could talk with him so Rand sits down on a barrel in the back of the inn to wait a little while.\nRand meets Min while waiting and she tells him about seeing things about people and the Pattern.

Mat tells Rand he's crazy and they start back to the inn meeting Thom on the way.

They ask what she's part of and if Min knows something, but Mat says grumpily that she's a part of the same bad luck they've had since Winternight. Rand quickly tells them that she saw Nynaeve arrive and talk to Mistress Alys and thought she might have something to do with them, something his friends accepts. Rand dislikes keeping things secret from his friends, but thinks that Min's secret can be dangerous for her, so he holds his tongue.\nWhen the party enter the room they'd eaten in the night before, Moiraine, Nynaeve and Egwene are seated and Lan is leaning against the mantel.\nThe rest of the men sit down and Lan offers Nynaeve a cup of wine as he asks her how she found them. When she tells him that she followed their trail, Lan looks surprised and remarks that he must be getting careless. She says that her father often took her hunting with him and taught her what he would have taught the sons he never had.\nWhen Nynaeve asks why she should help hide them, Thom tells her that there are people in Baerlon that would kill Moiraine for what she is, and Lan too. And since the rest are all associated with them, it's enough facts for the Whitecloaks. He says that the Whitecloak Questioners assume that you're guilty even before they start the interrogation and don't care about finding the truth.\nRand says that they must go on to Tar Valon when the Aes Sedai and the Wisdom start discussing what is safest for them. At last Moiraine tells Egwene and the others to leave her and Nynaeve alone and everybody but the two women leaves the room.\nRand starts wondering how Nynaeve can be a part of it and how any of them can be involved with Trollocs and Fades at all. The villagers stand outside the door with Lan for a while before Nynaeve walks out. When she looks at Rand, he realizes that the others had quietly left him alone with the Wisdom. When Rand asks her whether she's going to join them, she tells him that Mavra Mallen came from Deven Ride to see to things and that she'll want to return as soon as she can.\nShe tells him that the village meeting had been a shambles and that while everybody agreed that somebody should be sent for them, it didn't seem that they would come to an agreement on who should be sent. Nynaeve called the Woman's Circle together and told them what needed to be done, and while they didn't like it, they saw the right of it, and therefore she came.\nWhen Rand asks her about what Moiraine had told her, she says that she asked some questions about the boys and when Rand tells him that Tam had said he wasn't his son, she tells him that people say weird things in a fever, things that are not true.\nFurther on, she says that when Tam returned to Emond's Field, he brought a red-haired outlander wife and a babe. Kari al'Thor took care of that babe with as much love and delight as any other woman with a babe.\nRand then asks her what she's going to do and she tells him that they will have to see.\n",

                    "Summary": "Rand walks toward the common room after Nynaeve left him. He wants to hear people laugh and to forget what the Wisdom has said. When he enters the crowded room he sees that Thom is performing The Great Hunt of the Horn and he makes his way and sits down next to Perrin and Mat.\nThe gleeman performs 'The Bargain of Rogosh Eagle-eye', 'Lian's Stand', 'The Fall of Aleth-Loriel', 'Gaidal Cain's Sword' and 'The Last Ride of Buad of Albhain'. Finally he exchanges his harp with his flute and two men join him with a drum and a hammered dulcimer.\nThey clear the room for dancing and when Rand dances, he finds himself staring at a man with a scar crossing his whole face. He quickly looks away and wonders if he has insulted the man. Rand then dances with Nynaeve, Moiraine and Egwene before sitting down on the bench.\nToward midnight Moiraine and Egwene leave, and after one dance Nynaeve follows them. Lan walks up to Mat, Perrin and Rand and tells them that they should get to bed since they need to make an early start. Mat tells the Warder that a scarred man has been staring at him and Rand says that he stared at him too. Lan says that according to Master Fitch he's a spy for the Whitecloaks, but no worry for them.\nThe others go to their rooms but Rand decides to get some milk. He hurries to the kitchen and when he come out, a Fade walks toward him from the shadows and tells him that he is one of them. Rand wants to run but he cannot break free from the eye-less gaze. The Myrddraal says that Rand belongs to the Great Lord of the Dark before it darts down the hall and loses itself in the shadows. Lan leaps down the stairs, sword in hand, when Rand tells him what has happened. He says that they are leaving. The others join them and they walk to the stables to get their horses.\nThey ride down the streets of Baerlon alone, and when they reach the Caemlyn Gate, Lan wakes a Watchman and makes him open the gates. Five Whitecloaks appear and asks them who they are and why they want to leave at night. They tell them that a Draghkar has been seen flying over the town.\nOne of the Whitecloaks, Bornhald, recognizes Rand and tells the Watchmen that Rand's party are Darkfriends and that they will take them to their camp. Moiraine then starts talking, her voice coming from every direction. She seems to grow taller and Bornhald shouts 'Aes Sedai' while unsheathing his sword to attack Moiraine. She blocks his attack with her staff causing the Whitecloak to hurl back into his companions, sending them all down in a heap.\nLan commands the others through the gate and when Rand turns, he sees that Moiraine's head and shoulders are above the wall. They stop about fifty paces from the wall and watch the Aes Sedai step over the wall. When her feet are on the ground outside, she's suddenly back to her normal size again.\nEven though Bornhald commands the Watchmen to hold the gates, they close and seal them. When Moiraine catches up with them, Egwene looks at her in awe and says how she was taller than a giant. She responds by saying that the mind plays tricks at night and the eye sees what is not there.\nThey move down the Caemlyn Road at an easy pace. After an hour, they see flames over Baerlon and Moiraine tells them that it's the inn. Nynaeve gets angry and asks her how she can say it so easily and why she doesn't help. The Aes Sedai tells her that she will send Master Fitch gold enough to rebuild the Stag and Lion. They continue their trip down the road till they make camp. Lan gives them one hour to sleep on.\nMat, Perrin and Rand whisper about whether they will be safe in Tar Valon before they fall asleep at last.\nLan wakes them just before dawn, and once they have rolled the blankets together and strapped them behind their saddles, they start riding again. At sunrise they eat breakfast in their saddles, all bleary-eyed and huddling in their cloaks except Lan. The Warder's eyes are searching constantly as if he expects an ambush at any moment.\n",

                    "Summary": "Three days after leaving Baerlon, the party stops at the top of a hill. Lan is studying the road ahead and behind while the others sit under some trees eating. Egwene talks about how good some tea would've been and Nynaeve tells her that flatwort tea and andilay root are best for fatigue. The Warder tells them that they have a Fade or two and their Trollocs on their tail who know what road they're taking. Thom asks what stops them from having someone or something at Whitebridge already when a horn sounds from the west. The Warder tells him that nothing stops them and that they must trust the Light, but now they know for certain that there are Trollocs behind them.\nThey mount their horses when a second horn blows and this time another answers. Lan tells Moiraine to keep them moving and sets off heading west. Moiraine responds \"The Light go with you, last Lord of Seven Towers\", before she moves on with the others at a steady trot. Rand wonders what last Lord of Seven Towers means, when the horns sound again, closer this time, maybe seven or eight miles behind.\nWhen Nynaeve urges them to go faster, the Aes Sedai tells her that that may be what they are wishing for, and keeps the same steady pace.\nEvery time the horns sound, it sounds closer. When Rand thinks they are about five miles away, Lan comes galloping over the hill behind them and tells Moiraine that there are at least three fists of Trollocs, maybe five, each led by a Halfman. He says that they are closing the gap and will be on them in an hour or less. Suddenly a horn sounds in the west, behind them and is answered from one ahead of them.\nThe Aes Sedai says that they can go south or north, when Lan says that there is a place the Trollocs won't go. Moiraine says no, but after some discussion, they decide to go north.\nThey ride through the woods and hear the horns directly behind them. They top a hill and below them they meet an army of Trollocs led by a Myrddraal. The Fade unsheathes its sword and rides at Lan, followed by the Trollocs. The Warder cries to the rest to stay with him before he sets down the hill, shouting \"for the Seven Towers\". The rest of the group streams after Lan, and caught up by Lan's cry, Rand shouts \"Manetheren! Manetheren!\", repeated by Perrin. Mat shouts \"Carai an Caldazar! Carai an Ellisande! Al Ellisande!\"\nThe Warder and Myrddraal fight alone in a clear circle while Rand rides about, swinging his sword with the little skill Lan has taught him. Nynaeve and Egwene are close to Moiraine who lashes out with her staff, causing fire to envelop Trollocs. Rand is surrounded by Trollocs who try to unhorse him when suddenly all of them fall on the ground shouting. He then sees the Myrddraal sitting in its saddle without a head. Thom yells that it won't die until nightfall while Lan urges them on. They can hear the horns from west, east and south.\nRand turns and sees that only a hundred spans is separating the Trollocs and his party. Moiraine climbs down from Aldieb's back and takes out the angreal. With the angreal in one hand and the staff in the other she faces the Trollocs and the three Fades. She raises her staff and stabs it down in the earth, causing the ground to tremble and ripple. The Trollocs begin to tumble down the slope in heaps yet the Myrddraal moves forward in a line, their horses never missing a step. The Aes Sedai then lifts her staff and the earth stills. She points to the hollow between the hills and flames spread as far as the eye can see, creating a wall between the Trollocs and the humans. Lan then makes them go on while he takes care of Moiraine who nearly falls on the ground.\nThey soon catch up with the others and Moiraine tells them that she will be all right soon and that she's not at her strongest while working with Earth and Fire. After some riding, Lan stops and talks alone with Moiraine. Egwene asks Rand about the things he shouted at the Trollocs and he says that they had to shout something, as that's what you do in times like that. Perrin adds that they had a right since Moiraine said they all were descended from Manetheren. Egwene says that it wasn't that she meant, but what Mat was shouting. He tells her that he can't remember where it came from or what it meant, and Egwene says that for a moment she thought she understood him, though it's gone now. Moiraine comes up to them and says that it means 'for the honor of the Red Eagle. For the honor of the Rose of the Sun. The Rose of the Sun'; the ancient warcry of Manetheren and the warcry of its last king. She says that the blood of Arad's lines is strong in the Two Rivers and that the old blood still sings.\nHorns start blowing again, and Lan says the Trollocs have passed the fire and that Moiraine is not strong enough for what she intends and that she needs rest. And neither Myrddraal nor Trolloc will enter that place. Moiraine sighs, but agrees, and gets the others to gather close around her. She stands in her stirrups and starts swinging the staff over their heads, before thrusting it out to the west. She tells them it's for the Trollocs, that their scents and tracks will seem to follow it. They set off again, and soon they reach something that Rand believes is a cliff first but when he looks closer he understands that it is a city at least fifty times as big as Baerlon. When Egwene wonders what city it was, Moiraine tells her that it was called Aridhol and it was an ally to Manetheren in the Trolloc Wars. Later, the place died and got another name: Shadar Logoth.\n",

                    "Summary": "They ride into the city, and although the city was broken, Rand is awed by what's left standing. The largest building in Baerlon would have disappeared in the shadows of almost everything in the city; marble palaces topped with huge domes, bronze fountains, statues and towers. Rand thinks to himself of how Thom, Lan and Moiraine must have laughed up their sleeves at him, thinking Baerlon was a city. He is so caught up in staring at everything that he is taken by surprise when Lan stops them in front of a white stone building, twice as big as the Stag and Lion. Moiraine nods, and Lan commands the 'farm boys' to bring the horses inside.\nThey gather the horses and bring them in where Moiraine is laying. She asks Nynaeve if she has any herbs that will help her sleep an hour and not leave her groggy and the Wisdom tells her about a tea.\nThom, Mat, Perrin and Rand walk into a chamber where they unsaddle their horses. Mat gets a glum stare on his face and Rand asks him what's wrong. He says that he's thinking of Aemon's war cry, and Perrin tells him that maybe he's Aemon reborn when Thom warns him that that is dangerous talk and nothing to be spoken of lightly. The gleeman then goes back to the front room to have a smoke. Mat asks the others why don't they go and see more of the city, but Perrin asks him if he's forgetting the Trollocs. Rand says that Aridhol must have been the greatest city in the Trolloc Wars for the Trollocs to still be afraid of it. They agree at last and walk out on the streets of Aridhol.\nThey wander in and out of the biggest buildings they can find and climb into dusty fountains with huge basins, but find nothing more than dust and rubble. After some time even Mat grows tired and they sit down on the steps of a tall building, arguing about what to do next. Rand wants to go back to sleep, but Mat says that there might be treasure. When Rand tells him that it's getting late, Mat says he wants to climb one of the whole towers. A man's voice then speaks and says that the towers are not safe. They ask him who he is and he introduces himself as Mordeth, a treasure hunter. They tell him that they are going to Caemlyn, and he asks them if they would like to help him carry a treasure he's found to his horses. They accept and he leads them into the building and down some steps before they enter a tile-walled room filled with mounds of jewelry, coins, goblets, platters, swords and gems. They decide to come back tomorrow and explain that Moiraine and Lan will understand when they see an axe Perrin is taking with him. Mordeth asks them if they are alone and Mat answers that they're in the company of Moiraine, Lan, Nynaeve, Egwene and Thom and that they're going to Tar Valon.\nThis causes Mordeth's face to twist in rage and fear and he accuses them of lying to him. Perrin carefully puts the axe back and asks whether they should return tomorrow. When Mordeth is about to answer, Rand figures out what is wrong with Mordeth - he doesn't have a shadow. Mordeth says 'it is decided,' and swells like a balloon. They panic and start yelling then suddenly Mordeth is sitting in the corner of the room clutching his knees to his chest, wailing. He then shouts 'You are all dead!' then disappears.\nThey run up the steps and get out on the streets. From there they keep in the middle of the street and walk fast back to camp. At twilight, they come in sight of the white stone building and they run to it and through the doorway. Everyone except Lan is there. Nynaeve tells them that he is off looking for them. Moiraine asks them what has happened and they start to tell her, all in different places and none in the order it had happened. Moiraine suddenly grabs Rand's wrist at the mention of Mordeth and asks if he gave them anything or touched them. They say no and Mat says that they thought it was safe in the city since Trollocs wouldn't dare coming in. She tells them a story of thousands of Trollocs, Darkfriends, Myrddraal and Dreadlords that had camped in Shadar Logoth late in the Trolloc Wars that never came back out.\nShe then tells them about how the man Mordeth came to Aridhol when it seemed as though the Father of Lies must surely conquer. He spoke to Balwen, the King in Aridhol, and soon he was second only to the King. Aridhol started to draw in on itself, and used the battle cry: 'the victory of the Light is all'. She tells them about how Aridhol was destroyed by itself and named Shadar Logoth, Shadow's Waiting.\nThey then go to sleep but Rand wakes up on Lan's return. Lan tells Moiraine that there are Trollocs inside the gates before he starts waking the others. Moiraine tells them that they will make for the river where she can raise a small ward while they make rafts and cross over, or they may be able to hail a trader's boat from Saldaea. Lan explains that neither Trollocs or Myrddraal can swim and that they loathe deep water. The Aes Sedai commands them to get to their horses, as they're not yet over the river.\n",

She warily watches the woods for Trollocs as well as the ground ahead of her for any tracks that'll help lead her to the boys and Egwene.\nNynaeve catches the scent of wood smoke and stalks through the woods to a clearing where Moiraine and Lan are speaking. Hiding behind a tree Nynaeve listens to Moiraine and Lan talk about the Trollocs the night before and wonder how they'd gotten so far from the Borderlands so quickly. Moiraine tells Lan that she'd done some searching and says that one of the boys is across the river and there is a faint trace of the others downriver.\nMoiraine senses Nynaeve and tells her to come out and Lan whirls around drawing his sword. Nynaeve feels some satisfaction that the Warder was unaware of her. Nynaeve approaches Moiraine demanding to know what dirty Aes Sedai schemes she got Egwene and the boys into. Lan raises his arm and bars Nynaeve's way. Moiraine tells Nynaeve that she can wield the One Power and that's how she could sense her. Nynaeve thinks that the Aes Sedai is trying to off balance her and denies what Moiraine says.\nMoiraine talks of the people in Emond's Field telling her about all the wonderful things their young Wisdom could do. Nynaeve only answers that Mistress Barran taught her well. Moiraine goes on saying that some years ago there must've been something Nynaeve wanted more than anything else and she got it. Moiraine says that Nynaeve must've Healed either Egwene or Perrin and that is how she had found them at the inn in Baerlon.\nMoiraine tells Nynaeve that she is lucky to have managed crude control of the Power, that if she hadn't, it would've killed her as it may kill Egwene if she is untrained. Nynaeve replies that if she could learn to control it, so could Egwene. Moiraine says that the reactions from using the Power will eventually lead to a violent death that would last days and that there is nothing that can be done once it's begun.\nNynaeve also learns from Moiraine that she has great potential and with training could become even more powerful than Egwene who could be one of the most powerful in centuries. Nynaeve asks hesitantly for Moiraine not to tell anyone about this.\nWhen asked about the boys, Moiraine says that the Dark One wants them and that she opposes anything the Dark One wants. Moiraine tells Lan that they will be heading south and that the Wisdom will not be accompanying them to which Nynaeve replies that she will, thinking to herself she will not leave the Emond's Fielders alone with an Aes Sedai.\nLan goes to recover Nynaeve's horse and Nynaeve smiles, thinking that he'll never find her tracks. Moiraine says she'll be able to find the boys by a token she had given each of them. Two of the boys have lost their coins though, so Moiraine believes they will need her help first even though the third boy is only a few miles away across the river. Nynaeve is worried about Egwene, but the Aes Sedai says it's the boys the Dark One wants, not Egwene.\nLan returns with Nynaeve's horse and they set out south.\n",

Perrin asks her not to use the One Power and she refuses asking him if he'd give up his axe or walk around with one hand tied behind his back.\nOne afternoon they find Queens Crown mushrooms and begin laughing and telling stories they remember of Emond's Field.\nThey smell smoke of a cook fire and Perrin goes to see what it is, telling Egwene to wait where she is. Perrin goes off and peering around a tree discovers a lean sun browned man resting near the fire. His clothes made of furs. The man peeks an eye open and invites Perrin and his friend over for something to eat. Perrin calls for Egwene and introduces himself to the man. The man then introduces himself as Elyas Machera. Perrin gasps when he notices Elyas eyes were as yellow as polished gold.\nEgwene shows up and Perrin introduces her while she eyes the cooked rabbits Elyas has over the fire. They eat and Elyas asks them what they're doing out in the wilderness. Egwene answers that they're headed for Caemlyn and Elyas laughs, telling them they'll pass a hundred miles north of it going the way they were.\nEgwene asks Elyas if he would show them the way and he responds saying that he doesn't like people much and that cities are full of them. He says he doesn't go near villages or farms much, that people don't like his friends. Egwene wants to know which way to go then Elyas tells them to be quiet, that his friends are coming.\nFour wolves appear and lay down by the fire. Perrin notices more wolf eyes in the darkness around them, he reaches for his axe and Elyas tells him not to do that. Perrin leaves the axe alone.\nElyas named the four wolves by the fire; Dapple, Hopper, Burn and Wind. Perrin wondered how Elyas could talk to them. Elyas says that the wolves are the ones that discover the people not the people them. Elyas tells them that the wolves approached where ever he went. And then they seemed to know what he was thinking and responded to him. He says that wolves and men have not hunted together for a very long time.\nEgwene finds it interesting and wants to know if speaking to the wolves can be taught.

Perrin shifts uncomfortably.\nElyas still wants to know what they're doing out there and Egwene tells him a story her and Perrin had worked on in case they ever meet anyone. Elyas tells them that they're lying. That the wolves told him so. Perrin then tells Elyas the truth. When Perrin finishes his tale, Elyas says that he doesn't hold well with Aes Sedai, that the Red Ajah wanted to gentle him. And that no Aes Sedai would take kindly to him after he killed a couple Warders. Elyas says it's bad business to kill Warders and that he doesn't like it. Elyas goes on to say that talking to wolves is older than Aes Sedai and doesn't have to do with the One Power.\nElyas offers to Perrin and Egwene to stay with him and the wolves, that it'd be safer for them. Egwene says that they're going to Caemlyn then Tar Valon and Perrin agrees after a sarcastic conversation with himself. Elyas says he and the pack will travel with them, that Dapple says so and she leads the pack.

                    "Summary": "Rand dreams of walking through a maze of spires and bridges that go on forever. Ba'alzamon is within the maze as well and searching for him.\nRand pricks his finger on the thorn bushes that make up the maze wall, letting Rand know this place is dangerous. Trying to escape the maze, Rand comes face to face with Ba'alzamon. Rand begs for the Light to save him and Ba'alzamon answers back the \"The light will not save you and the Eye of the World will not serve you.\"\nBa'alzamon reaches for Rand and Rand shouts that this is a dream. Ba'alzamon, surprised, fades away.\nRand turns full circle and stares at thousands of reflections of himself staring back. Ba'alzamon appears in each of the reflections behind Rand's own image staring at him, their faces merging together.\nRand starts awake and searching around with his eyes realizes he is aboard the Spray. He is relieved at first until he notices his finger - pricked on the thorns in the dream - is bleeding. Rand's breath catches.\nThe Spray continues down river, Domon drives his crew hard trying to make good speed, all the time reminding them of the Trollocs that attacked them days earlier. Domon hangs up the Trolloc weapons for all to see whenever the crew begins to feel like the danger has passed.\nGelb tries causing trouble for Rand, Mat and Thom, but the crew won't listen to him thinking that it's Gelb's fault in the first place that the Trollocs attacked the ship. Rand is concerned Gelb will cause them trouble but Thom thinks they have more to worry about from the crew if they mutiny.\nThom entertains Domon's crew and at the same time teaches Rand and Mat to be his apprentices teaching them some of the easier stories, some tumbling and juggling.\nRand watches the shores pass by and notices a tower of polished metal.  Domon makes a few comments about the tower, that it's two hundred feet high and has no mark or opening on it. Mat says he bets there's treasure inside. Domon agrees that there may be and then goes on telling about a few other strange sights in the world. He makes a comment about when the Emond's Fielders go back to their home that it'll be too small to contain them. Rand disagrees and says he will go home some day and raise sheep like Tam. Rand then asks Mat if he's right and Mat, pulling himself away from looking at the tower says of course they'll go home, then walks off muttering about treasure.\nA few days pass and Rand sits upon the mast of the ship watching the crew and everything else. He nearly falls at one point and laughs about it. Thom and the crew watch him, thinking that Rand has gone mad and tell him to come down. Rand slides down the mast and jumps to the deck right in front of Mat. Rand stares at Mat and what he held - a curved dagger with a gold scabbard and a ruby the size of Rand's thumb nail. Mat notices Rand and stuffs the dagger back in his coat. Rand asks if it came from Shadar Logoth and Mat tells him that Rand cannot tell anyone about the dagger.\nRand also asks Mat if he has had dreams lately. Mat has, but doesn't want to talk about them.\nThom comes over before Rand or Mat can say anymore about dreams and tells them that he convinced Domon that Rand's fool stunt up on the mast was part of his training. Rand looks up at the mast and is shocked that he was up there. Thom begins teaching them more gleeman arts.\n",

                    "Summary": "Perrin, Egwene and Elyas travel southeast together. Egwene and Bela are nervous about the wolves they can't see. Perrin can feel the wolves and tries to tell Egwene that she doesn't need to worry to which she replies that she isn't worried.\nElyas tells Egwene that the wolves are far enough to avoid any people they meet, yet close enough to help if there is any danger.\nEgwene insists everyone take a turn riding, even Elyas. Elyas replies that his legs are good enough for him. Egwene tries to argue that it makes sense to take turns, but Elyas just looks at her with his yellow eyes and she backs away.\nPerrin feels the wolves around them, when they come, when they're ahead, when they're behind. In his dreams wolves are always nearby. Elyas gets food for Perrin and Egwene, they eat well while with him, but Perrin feels that he'd just as well starve than travel with Elyas and the wolves.\nAs they approach a large grouping of trees, three dogs as tall as the wolves and heavier appeared snarling and baring teeth. Perrin gets his sling ready, but Elyas stops him. Elyas raises a finger and whistles high and shrill, the dogs growling ceases and they step back watching his finger. Lowering his whistle and finger together, the dogs lay down happy as pups. Elyas pats the dogs and says that there will be Tuatha'an, Tinkers. Egwene doesn't like the idea of meeting Tinkers, she thinks they're thieves. Elyas says they steal no more than any other folk and Perrin says he's always wanted to meet a Tinker and suggests they stay with them for the night. Elyas says they may as well stay with them, but not to listen to what the Tuatha'an say. Elyas thinks their views are foolishness. As they walk into the woods, Perrin feels the wolves stay back. The wolves avoid people and were contemptuous of the dogs that gave up their freedom.\nThe Tinkers camp consisted of colorful wagons that were more like houses on wheels. The Tinkers themselves wore clothes as colorful as the wagons, so colorful it hurt Perrin's eyes to look at. The Tinkers played music and danced, children played with dogs. The music and merriment stops as Perrin, Elyas and Egwene walk up and everyone stares at them. A man, Raen-the Mahdi (old tongue for 'Seeker' - the leader of the Tuatha'an people) approaches and says they are welcome to their fires and asks if they know the song. Elyas replies with a bow and says he does not know the song. The man then says they will continue to seek then and welcomes them to dinner, the merriment picks back up again.\nRaen and Elyas already know each other from years back. Egwene asks about the song that was mentioned and Elyas says that it is what they seek, that it was lost during the Breaking of the World and when it's found again the paradise of the Age of Legends will return. Elyas says the Tinkers don't even know anything about the song but believe they'll know it when they find it.\nThey join Raen at his campfire and meet Ila, Raen's wife and Aram their grandson. Aram takes a liking to Egwene. Aram mentions the Way of the Leaf and Egwene asks about it. Aram explains that the leaf lives its appointed time, doesn't struggle against the wind, does no harm and lastly falls to the ground to nourish new leaves. Perrin asks what it means and Raen replies that no man should harm another person whatsoever. Raen says 'violence harms the person who does it as much as the one who receives it.' Elyas grows impatient with the talk and calls for enough of it, he says people don't like Tinkers because they preach their Way of the Leaf and that it lures young folk away from their homes. Raen is patient with Elyas and Perrin's views. Perrin tells Raen he doesn't look for trouble, but if someone caused some for him, he'd give it back to them. Egwene finds it interesting to meet someone who doesn't think his muscles can solve everything. Aram invites Egwene to show her the camp and she accepts going off with him. Raen says Aram is a good lad, but seems to find the Way of the Leaf a hard way to live.\nThey eat dinner and after lighting their pipes, Raen tells a tale about a band of Tinkers crossing the Waste two years earlier. The Tinkers encountered a group of Far Dareis Mai-Maidens of the Spear who had gone into the Blight and were returning when they were attacked by Trollocs that had followed them. The Maidens were all dead save one who crawled to the Tinkers wagons to give them a message despite her loathing of them. \"Leafblighter means to blind the Eye of the World. He means to slay the Great Serpent. Warn the People. Sightburner comes. Tell them to stand ready for He Who Comes With the Dawn.\" and as she continued her warning message, she died. Raen thinks Elyas might know something, but he doesn't.\nPerrin thinks over the Aiel woman's message and wonders about Elyas when Egwene returns, singing to herself. Egwene says Aram is a nice boy and she had fun dancing, laughing and eating dinner with him. Egwene suddenly throws her arms around Perrin and weeps into his shirt begging him to tell her that their friends are alive. Perrin says they are and she brushes tears quickly from her face, saying goodnight and giving him a kiss on the cheek. Perrin thinks that Rand might have understood what just happened, but he himself doesn't. Perrin hears the wolves howl in the distance, they would be waiting for him in his dreams.\n",

Thom raises the question of what Rand and Mat intend to do if they do not find Moiraine in Whitebridge. Before the boys can answer the ship arrives in Whitebridge.\nCaptain Domon tells Floran Gelb to get off his ship and offers Thom and the boys passage to Illian if they will keep the crew motivated to work as hard as they have on the way to Whitebridge. Thom wants to take the offer but the boys want to search for Moiraine, so Thom tells Domon he will consider it.\nThom takes Rand and Mat to the town center passing the White Bridge - a remnant from the Age of Legends that gave the town its name. They enter The Wayfarers' Rest and ask Innkeeper Bartim for a place where they can talk in private. Bartim leads them to a table and offers Thom a room and a meal for a good price if he will perform tonight. Thom says he will consider it, and tells the boys when Bartim has gone to get them a drink that the offer is cheap.\nWhen Batrim returns they ask him for news. Bartim tells them about the false Dragon Logain, how he was captured and that he can channel. He also tells them something about the Hunt of the Horn being called in Illian. Thom considers going to Illian again. Rand inquires after their companions while Thom is lost in thought for a moment. The innkeeper's reaction to that is peculiar. He wants them to leave as soon as they finish their drinks. After some more questions they learn that both Fain and a Fade inquired after them.\nThe Innkeeper leaves again and Thom urges the boys to take Domon's offer. Rand and Mat still refuse. Mat is on the brink of violence and clutches his dagger. At that moment they hear Gelb telling stories about Trollocs chasing Domon's ship. Thom now sees himself forced to abandon the plan to go to Illian. Rand and Mat want to know why Thom stays with them. Thom tells him about his nephew Owyn who got in trouble with Aes Sedai. Rand suspects Owyn could channel but Thom doesn't admit that. They decide to sneak out of the inn and make a run for it to Caemlyn.\nThom divides their coin into three shares and they sneak out of the inn. Thom hands Rand his things while he goes to get another cloak to replace his gleeman one. As they head for the road to Caemlyn a Fade appears. Thom turns to face it and tells the boys to run and go to an inn in Caemlyn called The Queen's Blessing. Rand and Mat hear Thom cry out in pain as they flee towards the Caemlyn Road. Mat thinks Thom is dead, but Rand has trouble accepting that.\n",

                    "Summary": "Bors is standing in a vaulted chamber, with a hundred other people wandering around. He has no idea where the chamber is. As he looks around the room, a serving girl clad in white offers him a drink; Bors, afraid both of seeming untrusting and of poison, accepts without any intention of drinking.\nEveryone in the chamber, including Bors, is wearing a black mask, although a quarter of them have not bothered with disguises beyond the masks. As Bors studies the other people, he marks out a woman from Illian, and another from Arad Doman. There is a Shienaran man, and people from Kandor, Cairhien, Saldaea and Ghealdan. Merchants, warriors, commoners, nobles...all are represented in this crowd, and Bors even spots a Tinker. As he continues to look around, he finds that even though others are disguised more thoroughly, he can still tell who they are. He sees a High Lord of Tear, an Andoran Queen's Guard and an Atha'an Miere. And then, suddenly, his eyes catch sight of something surprising; an Aes Sedai, or at least a woman who has been trained in the White Tower, wearing a gold serpent ring. He quickly looks away, only to find himself looking upon another, and he silently curses them.\nA chime sounds, and the tall door at the far end of the chamber swings open, allowing two Trollocs to enter. They ignore the humans, and simply turn towards the door, bowing and cringing. They are followed by a Myrddraal. Everyone is shying away in fear, and for a time, the creature does not speak. Finally he announces: \"Your master comes. To your bellies, worms! Grovel, lest his brilliance blind and burn you!\" Bors is overwhelmed with rage, more so at the tone of the Myrddraal's voice than its words, until the air above the Myrddraal's head begins to shimmer.\nBors immediately drops to the ground as the import hits him. \"It can't be!\" he thinks to himself. He notices that the Trollocs were on the ground even before he was.\n\"The Great Lord of the Dark is my Master, and most heartily do I serve him to the last shred of my very soul,\" the Myrddraal tells them. Meanwhile, Bors is frightened nearly to death, and keeps reminding himself that the Dark One and the Forsaken are bound in Shayol Ghul. \"The hand of the Creator shelters us all, and the Light protects us from the Shadow,\" he thinks to himself, before he reminds himself that he now serves a different master.\nA mellifluous voice tells the humans to rise, and Bors looks up in shock, only to see the figure of a man floating in the air above the Myrddraal. He is masked in blood red. Bors wonders why the Great Lord of the Dark would appear to them as a man, and masked. Yet the Myrddraal is cowering, so Bors thinks that perhaps it is one of the Forsaken. The figure tells them to call him by the name of Ba'alzamon, striking great fear into everyone in the room.\nBa'alzamon informs them that the chamber they are in stands in the shadow of Shayol Ghul, and several people moan at this pronouncement. He continues on, almost mockingly, telling them not to fear, as the day of their Master's rising is near at hand and that the Day of Return draws near. He says that soon the Wheel of Time will be broken and that the Great Serpent will die, and that the Great Lord will remake the world in his own image. \"And those who serve me, faithful and steadfast, will sit at my feet above the stars in the sky and rule the world of men forever. So have I promised, and so shall it be, without end. You shall live and rule forever.\"\nThe air to the left of Ba'alzamon begins to shimmer, and the figure of a young countryman appears, mischief in his brown eyes and the hint of a smile on his lips. The air to Ba'alzamon's right shimmers, and another countryman appears, a curly-haired, yellow-eyed youth with heavy muscles and a battle-axe hanging at his side. A third figure appears, directly under Ba'alzamon's eye, almost at his feet. This one is tall, with dark, reddish hair, and a heron-marked sword hangs at his side. Ba'alzamon tells them that one who walks the world will become the Dragon Reborn. The Shienaran man asks eagerly if they are to kill him and Ba'alzamon tells him perhaps yes, perhaps no. He informs them that he wishes to have the Dragon Reborn turned over to his side. He tells them all to study the images before them so that they can recognize the three men.\nEveryone begins to shift uneasily, except, Bors notices, for the Illianer woman; she is acting as if she is speaking to someone in front of her, though he cannot see whom and cannot hear what she says. She nods, her eyes half terrified, half ecstatic. Then she arches her back and rises to her toes, as if some unseen hand is holding her up; when she settles back to her feet, she is shivering, nodding and bowing. As she straightens, the woman next to her...one of the Aes Sedai...begins nodding as if she is now being spoken to.\nEventually, the red-masked face of Ba'azalmon fills Bors' vision. Ba'alzamon asks him if he is faithful, and Bors swears that he is. Ba'alzamon then gives Bors his instructions. He is to return to Tarabon to continue his work there and is told to redouble his efforts. He is also to watch out for the three young men. Thirdly, he is to speak to no one of those who have landed at Toman Head. Ba'alzamon continues giving instructions, and they make no sense to Bors. He then feels hands grasping his head, and images flash through his mind. A sky of striated clouds, red, yellow and black, driven by a mighty wind; a woman dressed in white who recedes into blackness; a raven staring him in the eye; a man in armor with a helm shaped like an insect; a curled, golden horn; a wolf ripping out his throat; the skies raining fire, and the moon and stars falling; rivers running in blood, and the dead walking; the earth splitting open and fountains of molten rock...\nSuddenly, the images are over and Bors finds himself half-crouching in the chamber while Ba'alzamon moves on to speak to a Tairen lord. Bors is then led away to his room by another white-clad servant.\n",

Rand concentrates on the flame and the void, feeding all of his emotions into a single flame until emptiness surrounds him. For a few moments, he and Lan trade blows with bundled lathes. They are trading blows back and forth when something unexpected happens to Rand. The wind, howling across the tower, freezes as if it had turned to jello, and begins pushing Rand forward. Lan quickly gets the advantage, and demands to know what 'fool move' Rand was trying to use. \"You know better by know, or should unless you have forgotten everything I've tried to teach you.\" Rand tries to explain what had happened, but Lan just stares at him and then helps him to his feet. \"Strange things can happen this close to the Blight,\" he says.\nRand wonders how Lan can act as if nothing happened, but his thoughts eventually drift to his heron-marked sword, which he picks up. The sword leads to thoughts of his father, Tam, and he once again begins to doubt the fact that Tam really is his father. Lan seems to almost read his mind and tells him that in the Borderlands, if a man has raised a child, then that child is his no matter what.\nRand remarks that he has to learn how to use the sword, and Lan tells him that he could always sell it. \"That blade is rare even among heron-mark swords. It would fetch a pretty price.\" Rand refuses, and says that he had thought all heron-mark blades were rare. Lan glances at him and says, \"Tam didn't tell you, then? He must know. Perhaps he didn't believe. Many do not.\" Lan then proceeds to tell Rand that, during the War of the Shadow, many weapons had been wrought with the One Power - such as Rand's sword. Rand is startled and jerks away from his weapon. \"I can't get away from them, can I?\" he asks. Lan ends up asking Rand if that is what he really wants - to get away from Aes Sedai - and then asks that if this is so, why hasn't he left yet? Rand replies that he hasn't left because Mat and Perrin are still in Fal Dara and he doesn't want to leave before they do, for fear that he might not see them again for a long time. The conversation turns to Egwene, which seems to be another reason that Rand is staying in Fal Dara. Lan asks Rand if he would have her accompany him, to give up a life in the Tower for a life of wandering, and Rand replies that he wouldn't let her go with him even if she asked.\n\"And that is all the reason? You want to spend as much time as you can with your friends from home before they go? That's why you're dragging your feet?\" Rand finally gives in and tells Lan that it is Moiraine, and Lan replies that he would be dead if not for Moiraine. They talk for a moment about circumstances between Rand and the Aes Sedai, and are about to get back to training when they hear a faint peal of trumpets. They see a large procession moving through the city, and upon seeing a banner bearing the Flame of Tar Valon, realize that it is a group of Aes Sedai. Rand asks Lan why there are so many of them, and Lan tells him that it is because the Amyrlin Seat has arrived in person. They end their lesson, and Lan tells Rand that it would be better if he was a week gone.\n",

He demands to know what they are doing, and Elansu, the Shatayan of Fal Dara keep, tells him that Moiraine wants them to have new clothes, which Lady Amalisa had ordered made for them. They tell him that he is to change out of the clothes that he is currently wearing; he does, and finds that he now has a whole wardrobe of new clothes.\nHe quickly changes, and then packs his bags, intending to leave Fal Dara as soon as he can.

Welcome is the Amyrlin Seat to Fal Dara, for here is the watch kept, here is the Pact maintained. Welcome.\"\nRand hurries by, more intent then ever on leaving.

He makes his way towards the sally gate, but finds that it is closed tight and guarded by Ragan and Masema. Rand tells them that he just wants to go out and hunt rabbits, but they inform him that Lord Agelmar has ordered that no one is to leave the keep. Rand laughs, asking why Agelmar would want to keep him inside the keep. Ragan and Masema do not have an answer for him, but will not let him leave. Rand finally says that he will just go walk in the gardens instead.\nRand, however, does not go to the gardens. He makes his way to the Carter's Gate, but finds that it is locked and guarded as well; it is the same with the Dog Gate. He is discouraged, and very afraid that the Amyrlin will find him and gentle him. He begins to wonder if it would really be so bad to be gentled, but recalls that men who are gentled almost always die soon afterwards. He makes his way through the keep, and finally ends up in a storeroom. He finds a semicircle of men kneeling in front of one of the walls, throwing dice. Loial is watching them, and the Ogier greets Rand before beginning to speak of the Amyrlin. \"She looks tired, don't you think? It cannot be easy, being Amyrlin. Worse than being an Elder, I suppose.\" Loial continues to say that the men will not dice with him, but simply say \"Glory to the Builders,\" whenever he suggests playing with them. Rand suddenly remembers that it was the Ogier who built Fal Dara, and asks Loial if he knows any way out of the keep other than through the gates. Loial tells him that though the Ogier built Mafal Dadaranell - an ancient city that once stood where Fal Dara now stands - that Fal Dara had been built by men. Rand insists that he needs to get out of Fal Dara. Loial, thinking that Rand is sick, calls for Mat and Perrin.\nBoth of the other Two Rivers boys appear, and they ask Rand why he thinks that he must leave. Finally, Mat asks how they will all get out of the keep, and Rand realizes that Mat and Perrin intend to accompany him. Knowing that he must go alone, Rand says some harsh things to them. \"Maybe I don't want you two going with me, always hanging around, falling into trouble and expecting me to pull you out. You ever think of that? Burn me, did it ever occur to you I might be tired of always having you there whenever I turn around? Always there, and I'm tired of it.\" Perrin looks hurt at his words, and Mat's face becomes stiff, and they leave. To get rid of Loial, Rand says, \"You are no use to me if you don't know a way out. Go on! Go find your trees, and your precious groves, if they haven't all been cut down, and good riddance to them if they have.\" Loial is shocked, and leaves. All of the Shienaran gamblers are staring at him, and he stumbles out of the storeroom.\nRand begins searching for somewhere that he can hide, but can't find a place that he thinks is safe enough. Eventually, he runs into Egwene. She tells him that she heard from Mat, Perrin and Loial what had happened earlier, and is very displeased. He doesn't care, and tries to get rid of her, too. \"There are plenty of Aes Sedai here for you to moon around, now. And don't tell any of them you saw me. They're after me, and I don't need you helping them.\" Egwene becomes upset that Rand thinks she would help the Aes Sedai capture him. He turns to walk away, but she throws herself at him, knocking them both to the floor. In an attempt to keep him from leaving, she sits on him. Rand threatens to do something to her with the One Power, but she tells him that, \"I know you cannot channel the One Power whenever you want; it just happens, and you cannot control it.\" She, on the other hand, has been taking lessons from Moiraine. To prove it, she channels, and a torch bursts into flame. Eventually, Rand tells Egwene what Lan had said earlier, and she decides to help him, suggesting that they go to the dungeon. Wary, he tries to jump to his feet, but Egwene assures him that he will not be hiding in a cell. She also mentions that Padan Fain is down there, and that since she often goes to visit him, no one will question their going into the dungeons.\nAt the door to the dungeon, they encounter Changu, who asks what they want. After he recognizes Egwene and asks who Rand is, he leads them to Padan Fain's cell. As Egwene approaches Fain, Rand hangs back; Padan Fain announces that he can feel that Rand is there, and says that Rand will never be able to hide from him. He then chants:\n'Soon comes the day all shall be free.\nEven you, and even me.\nSoon comes the day all shall die.\nSurely you, but never I.'\nEgwene backs away from him and Rand says that he has gone mad. Egwene says that perhaps this was not a good idea. \"Even if they don't look here, I cannot stay here with him like this, and I do not think you should, either. There is something about him today that....\" She stops, and then announces that she will take him to the women's apartments. \"... they will never look in the women's apartments. Never.\"\nAs they leave, Fain calls after them, \"It's never over, al'Thor. Never.\"\n",

                    "Summary": "Moiraine is in the women's apartments, adjusting her blue-fringed shawl about her shoulders. She is wondering why the Amyrlin Seat has arrived in person. As she finishes readying herself, she hears a knock on her door. When she opens it, two Aes Sedai stand at the door; Anaiya of the Blue Ajah, and Liandrin of the Red. Anaiya and Moiraine greet each other as old friends, but Liandrin acts coldly, telling Moiraine that the Amyrlin Seat requires her presence.\nThey begin to make their way through the corridors, and Liandrin tells Moiraine that three false Dragons have surfaced - one in Saldaea, one in Murandy and one in Tear, though only the one in Saldaea can actually channel. As they continue to walk, they run into the Lady Amalisa. She curtsies, and Moiraine tells her to rise, greeting her warmly. As they talk, Moiraine notices Egwene hurrying around a corner with a stooped figure following behind her. When she turns her attention back to the other three women, she is just in time to catch Liandrin accepting an invitation to tea from Amalisa. This causes her to wonder what Liandrin is up to, as the Red sister doesn't often make friends outside of her Ajah, and never makes friends who are not Aes Sedai.\nAfter Amalisa leaves, the talk turns to Andor. Moiraine is told that Morgase doesn't hold her throne as securely as the year before, but that there is also good news: the Daughter Heir is in Tar Valon. The conversation shifts once again, this time to the Great Hunt of the Horn, which has been called in Illian. Many people believe that the Last Battle is coming; the Sea Folk are agitated, and the Aiel appear to be stirring. Liandrin then mentions Almoth Plain, and Anaiya insists that it is simply a rumor. The rumor is that there may be fighting on Almoth Plain, and perhaps Toman Head as well. Moiraine and Anaiya speak shortly about this, and Liandrin finally gets impatient. She tells Moiraine that the Amyrlin is waiting for her, and mentions that, \"for you, the Amyrlin will have no idle talk.\"\nThey finally reach the anteroom, and are greeted by several more Aes Sedai. Verin Mathwin, Serafelle, Alanna Mosvani and Carlinya are among them. Leane, the Keeper of the Chronicles, enters and leads Moiraine into the next room, where the Amyrlin Seat awaits. Moiraine and Siuan greet each other formally, and Siuan speaks of their journey to Fal Dara. Moiraine goes on to tell Siuan that she has two girls who can channel with her. Siuan then mentions that she has heard that Moiraine is 'meddling' with a young man who is ta'veren, and that Elaida has approached the Hall of the Tower about this, wanting to see Moiraine punished. Moiraine admits that she has found three ta'veren.\nThe conversation turns to talk of change, of how new alliances are being formed within the White Tower, and of how Aes Sedai are now daring to go against thousands of years of custom and law. Finally, Siuan asks Leane to leave so that she and Moiraine can talk in private. When the Keeper leaves, Siuan wards the room, and then she and Moiraine embrace. They speak of how they have a duty that must be fulfilled, and the chapter ends with Siuan saying, \"Moiraine, if anyone, even Leane, discovers what we plan, we will both be stilled. And I can't say they would be wrong to do it.\"\n",

Perrin has torn out his eyes and is desperately trying to show Rand and proclaiming that he has \"gotten rid of them.\" Fain and Ba'alzamon both tell him that he can't hide before Rand awakens on Egwene's floor with Nynaeve knitting beside him.\nAfter a short dialogue in which Nynaeve accuses Rand of becoming too \"Shienarian\" he is told that Egwene went to help Padan Fain. Nynaeve informs Rand that the women have been acting odd, as if searching for something. Once again though it breaks into an argument when Rand names the Dark One and defends the action by claiming he is dead. It is evident Rand himself is not so sure when a wave of dizziness washes over him and he is once again reminded of the wind.\nThe alarm bell then goes off in the keep. Rand's first thought is they are looking for him. Nynaeve assures him that is unlikely because the bells would only warn him. Rand then figures out that it probably has something to do with Fain. Nynaeve desperately tries to convince him not to run out into the women's apartments. Reminding him that the women have been acting odd, and even if they hadn't they wouldn't take kindly to an armed man running through their quarters.\nRegardless, out Rand goes, to the dismay of the women and straight into the Amyrlin. He doesn't spend much time dwelling on this blunder or listening to Leane yelling at him and instead hurries on to where he encounters three Trollocs. He is not left alone to kill them as twelve Shienarians come to his aid. Rand doesn't wait to see the result and once again takes off running only to encounter a Myrddraal which Ingtar insists on taking himself; telling Rand that he should practice on some Trollocs first.\nAshamed at his cowardice he runs for the dungeon to notice the first oddity, a partially open door. Inside he finds chunks of flesh and the heads of the two guards. On the walls written in Blood are the words: \"We will meet again on Toman Head. It is never over, al'Thor.\" Desperately he tries to scrub off the message and in his panic fails to notice Liandrin's entrance until she uses the power on him to try to make him speak. Before serious harm is done Moiraine comes in and interrupts the struggle. Rand uses the moments of tension between the two Aes Sedai to explore further in the dungeon. The two prisoners left alive kill themselves from the horror they witnessed in the dungeon. It is then that Rand notices an unconscious Egwene and Mat.\nIt is quickly discovered that Mat's dagger is missing along with Fain. Liandrin points out that Rand was seen erasing the writing on the wall. Rand gets an uneasy feeling that even Moiraine is weighing him on this account. It is soon decided that Mat must be healed by the Amyrlin. Ingtar informs Rand that the Horn of Valere was stolen out of the storerooms. On further questioning it is revealed that the invaders entered and exited through the Dog Gate. Rand starts suspecting Ingtar but shakes the idea away.\nRand notices Verin for the first time studying the Trolloc script and describing it as \"interesting.\" He decides he doesn't want to get to know anyone who finds dark prophecies interesting. Lan finds Rand and tells him the women are already discussing which daughter would be best to marry to Rand. However, it is the news that Moiraine has said he can go anytime he wants now that interests him most.\n",

Rand grows frustrated because all he wishes to do is apologize. Soon the party comes upon some Trolloc tracks. Ingtar says they will continue to ride at the same speed regardless. Uno gives Rand a look which makes him nervous. Eventually Ingtar realizes the horses can't keep going at that pace so they dismount and trot beside them. Eventually night comes and they stop for the evening.\nRand goes to unpack his clothes but is upset because they are all extremely fancy. Ingtar tells him that Moiraine personally saw to the packing. After getting food from Masema, who is his usual crotchety self, he goes and sits with Ingtar, Mat, Perrin and Loial. He is pleased to see that Mat and Perrin don't move away from him this time. He questions Ingtar on why Uno and Masema keep looking at him strangely. He is told Uno is most likely wondering if he has earned the heron on his blade, and that Masema can't see anything but Aiel with him. Rand protests saying he is not Aiel, which is confirmed by Mat.\nThe next morning they once again start out, the pace just a tiny bit slower than the other day. They come across an abandoned camp where Hurin tells them that there was murder done. They ride northeast now until they come across another dead body and the direction again changes south. They continue like this until they come across the River Erinin. The village appears to be abandoned so Ingtar orders a search. They find nothing until Uno spots a woman in the window. When he gets there she is nowhere to be found. Instead there is a piece of drapery. Hurin says he has never smelled anything quite like what happened there before and is greatly disturbed by it.\nThey decided to continue on across the river. On the other side of the river they come across the brutally murdered bodies of Changu and Nidao. They bury them for there is no definite proof they were Darkfriends and they had saved Lord Agelmar's life earlier. They continue on again until they come across another village in their path. The village is also abandoned and Ingtar demands another search. Rand walks into one of the building and is trapped in a vision over and over again. In the dream the room is crawling with flies. When he finally snaps out of it he finds six dead flies. He doesn't have much time to dwell on it though before an alarm is sounded. He quickly runs to find a Myrddraal staked onto a door. All now worry as to what could have done that to a Myrddraal.\n",

Both she and Nynaeve get close to the Amyrlin and learn that someone had hurt her, \"a bowman not yet caught\". She is not harmed too badly and insists on leaving at once, despite Lord Agelmar's protests that \"this attempt on your life changes everything\". The Amyrlin refuses to stay until they have caught the bowman and then sees Egwene and Nynaeve. Moiraine admits that they are the two new novices and the Amyrlin points out that \"I sense a fine spark in each of them\". Egwene is nervous because the Amyrlin is looking at her like she was a tool, \"This one for this purpose, and that one for that\". The order is given and the group mount quickly and are on their way. The group is followed by cheers but Egwene's mood is less than happy. Nynaeve comforts her by pointing out that Rand \"has Lord Ingtar and twenty lances with him\".\nThe group move as quickly as they can over the next few days and the \"camps came late each night\". Each Ajah had their own tent and their Warders slept outside it; the Amyrlin and Leane each have their own tent and Egwene and Nynaeve share one. Lan comes to their tent once to see Nynaeve but she erupts in anger and he doesn't come again, even though \"He stood watching the tent from the darkness for a long time before he went away\". Moiraine does not come near them while they ride, preferring to speak \"with the other Aes Sedai, all but the Red sisters, drawing them aside one by one\". Egwene thinks that she has forgotten them but Nynaeve is not quite so sure, \"I'll believe she is done with us when she's dead - or us\".\nWhile they rest at night, Aes Sedai visit their tent; the first is Verin Mathwin Sedai. She comes to teach Egwene some more about channeling. Apparently, the fact that Egwene has started to channel, and does not have a block that prevents her from channeling, may be dangerous for her. Nynaeve has some control over her channeling and so doesn't have to take part in the lessons, though she does, grudgingly. Most novices are scared of what they can do with the One Power but some, like Egwene, are eager to learn more. That is why \"there was nothing for it but for her (Moiraine) to begin teaching you\". Although there is not too much danger now, Egwene's \"innate abilities are strong, child, and they will grow stronger\". She must be taught thoroughly and fairly quickly so that she doesn't hurt the people around her or herself.\nEgwene and Nynaeve try to embrace saidar by using a flower bud in their minds as a focus, \"You and the bud are one\". Egwene feels \"The merest trickle of it (saidar) seeping through her\" but loses it when she tries to force it. Nynaeve complains that she cannot feel anything but Verin convinces her to stay by describing the novice chores. Near the end of the lesson, the blankets burst into flame, proof that Nynaeve had just channeled, though \"I didn't mean to burn anything\". Verin channels the fire out but it signals the end of the lesson. She warns them one last time of channeling too much saidar, \"If you draw too much, you can destroy yourself\". Other Aes Sedai come to their tent in the evenings; Alviarin Sedai, \"cool and businesslike\", Alanna Sedai, a typical Green, and Liandrin Sedai who questions them endlessly about Rand, Mat and Perrin.\nEgwene begins to dream of Rand again, though her dreams have changed by the time they reach Medo. Medo is where they board the boats that will take them to Tar Valon. After being waved aside by a Yellow sister, Egwene finds Anaiya Sedai and asks to see Moiraine. Anaiya tells her that \"Moiraine is gone\" and Nynaeve has already been bundled onto the River Queen, \"I had to bundle her onto a boat myself\". Egwene learns that Moiraine has left the group along with Lan and that Liandrin and Verin have also disappeared. Now convinced that she cannot speak to Moiraine, Egwene tells Anaiya about her dreams. In them, there was \"a man with a mask over his face, and fire instead of eyes\", Ba'alzamon though she doesn't know it, who scared her. Then, there was an evil woman standing over Rand, who was sleeping, and they disappeared suddenly in a flash of light. Egwene senses that there is danger not far off and that Rand is walking into a trap. Anaiya explains that there is a slight chance that Egwene might be a Dreamer, which is very close to Foretelling but \"it could be just an ordinary nightmare\". Anaiya tells her that they will \"talk about it more on the River Queen\". She then leaves Egwene to board River Queen herself.\n",

What is even more alarming is that the stone they fell asleep next to is now upright in the centre of the hollow. The floor of the hollow is paved with white stone and there are steps up to the stone cylinder, each coloured in the same colours as the Aes Sedai Ajahs. The land around them is different too, \"everything seemed paler than it should be\". The land seems solid and so Rand wakes up Loial and Hurin; \"Wake up and tell me I'm dreaming\".\nImmediately both Hurin and Loial sense that they aren't in the same place they went to sleep in. Loial says that he knows what might have happened, \"I think I know what it (the stone) is now\". When Rand points out the coloured steps, Hurin thinks that Aes Sedai have done something to them, though Rand tries to comfort him, \"The Aes Sedai won't hurt you\". Loial explains that he read a book that contained a picture of a Stone like that, with emphasis on Stone. The book contained the quote \"From Stone to Stone run the lines of 'if', between the worlds that might be\". Aes Sedai from the Age of Legends used these Stones somehow, though only the most powerful of the Aes Sedai could use them.\nRand becomes uneasy at the mention of channeling as he went to sleep wrapped in the Void, \"Maybe I brought us here\". None of them understand the quote but Loial explains that the book had many questions in it about decisions; \"If a woman goes left, or right, does Time's flow divide? Does the Wheel then weave two Patterns?\" The book also said that there are lots of these Stones scattered around the land \"but I never heard of anyone finding one\".\nHurin speaks up then and seeks advice from Rand about how they are going to get home. He thinks that because Rand is a 'lord', he will see them out of this place. Rand now thinks that he sent them to this place and since \"you got him into this, you have to get him out\". He promises Hurin that \"I will do my best... by my House and my honour\". Hurin cheers up considerably, \"Hurin's grin was almost as wide as when Rand first met him\". Rand walks up to the Stone, convinced that it will get them back. Forming the void, Rand tries to reach for saidin but only feels the taint. He tries to form a picture of the original hollow outside the void and tries to push saidin into the picture.\nSuddenly, the void shatters \"into a thousand razor shards\" and Rand staggers back from the Stone, much to the puzzlement of Loial. Hurin is still standing confidently, still believing that Rand is going to get them safely home; \"as long as Rand was doing something, anything, Hurin would have confidence\". Rand says that he will try again in a few minutes but then Hurin suggests that they find the Darkfriends and force them to reveal how to get back. Rand is surprised that Hurin can still smell the trail and so Hurin explains that the trail is fainter, \"not old, not fainter like that\", and that they can follow that. Rand knows that they must find Fain, the Horn and the dagger and so decides that they will follow the trail. He sends Hurin off to find out if the trail is actually real.\nLoial has his doubts about leaving the Stone and wants to know how Rand was going to use the Stone since only channelers could use them. Rand answers that if they were around before the Age of Legends, there was the possibility that there would be another way to use them. Loial and Rand mount their horses and ride up to join Hurin. The world looks even stranger now; \"Whenever Rand turned his head, things that appeared distant when seen from the corner of eye seemed to rush towards him\". Hurin finds that the trail goes southwards and they begin to follow it, searching for the Horn.\n",

Everyone is ready to go but they wait to see if Uno can track the missing members; he can't, \"not a goat-kissing track, my Lord\". Ingtar will not accept that they have vanished, \"three men and three horses do not just vanish\", and orders another search of the area. Mat suggests that they ran away, though the Shienarans do not take this well. Mat nearly lets slip of his, Perrin and Rand's conversation the day before, though manages to catch himself. Ingtar doesn't believe that Hurin would run away, nor Rand now that he knows his duty. Ingtar is very angry that Hurin has disappeared as they depended on his tracking skills.\nPerrin doesn't know any reason as to why Rand, Hurin and Loial would leave together, though he too thinks back to their conversation. He thinks of the reason why he is there and realizes that they must continue to hunt the Darkfriends and that he can help the group. He contacts the wolves, though he is reluctant to do so at first. When he first learned that he could communicate with the wolves, he felt unclean and \"he was still not past that entirely\". He forms contact with the wolves who are surprised, \"Wolfbrother. Surprise. Two-legs that talks\", and ask if he is Long Tooth, the wolf name for Elyas Machera. He forms a picture of himself in his mind and finds that they have already given him a name, Young Bull. It surprises him that he has a wolf name and \"wished he could not remember how he'd earned it\".\nPerrin sends the smells of Rand, Hurin and Loial to the wolves; his sense of smell has increased since he became a Wolfbrother. The wolves only know that the three entered the hollow and \"that was the last they had seen or smelled Rand or the other two\". Perrin knows that he will not find Rand or the others but he can help the group find the Horn, though it will mean telling Ingtar, \"The next step would be useless unless he told Ingtar\". He sends the wolves the smell of Fain, \"not even Trollocs smelled so foul\", and masks it with the smell of Trollocs.\nThe smell of the Trollocs drives the wolves into a frenzy, \"fire and Trollocs they hated, and they'd go through fire to kill Trollocs\". Strangely, Fain's smell is even worse to the wolves and they are eager to kill the Trollocs on their land. Perrin understands that the Trollocs are south of the group and that the wolves will leave immediately to start the hunt, \"Kill them. Kill the Twisted Ones\". \"Their fury injected him\" and Perrin snarls, much to Mat's surprise. Mat begins to feel that Perrin is not like he used to be either.\nPerrin finds Ingtar and pulls him aside, \"he made sure Uno and the rest were too far away to hear\". He tells Ingtar that the Trollocs are heading south and admits that he can talk to wolves. Ingtar doesn't question this since \"I have heard of things like this\". Ingtar accepts his story but asks Perrin to say that he is a sniffer because \"some of them (the Shienarans) would not understand\". The soldiers accept the story and mount their horses; however, Mat is very sceptical, \"I am the only sane one left from Emond's Field\".\nThey start riding and Perrin keeps in contact with the wolves, straining to keep the wolves from going ahead too far. If the Trollocs were killed by the wolves, the Darkfriends would scatter with the Horn and they would not be able to track it. Perrin sees images from the wolves of the bodies of the murdered villagers and tells Ingtar, haltingly, of what he sees. Ingtar tells the group of some more bad news, \"There is someone following us\".\nIt turns out to be Verin Sedai who rides up to their group. She announces that \"Moiraine Sedai sent me\" and talks of the village she just passed though, the village with the Myrddraal. She suddenly notices that Rand is not with the group and Ingtar tells her that he \"vanished last night, without a trace\". He is unsettled to know that Verin knows that Hurin was a sniffer, \"It was never easy discovering Aes Sedai knew the secrets you were trying to keep from them\". Verin is very intent on finding out all about Rand and decides to travel with them, and rides with Ingtar at the head of the column. Mat is right when he says \"It's Rand she's after... not the Horn\".\n",

                    "Summary": "Rand, Loial and Hurin follow the faint trail in the unknown land, wrapped in silence. The strange way that the \"distant hills seemed to slide toward Rand\" makes him dizzy but the only way to avoid it is to be wrapped in the Void, something he wishes to avoid. Hurin is focused on the trail, \"as if he was trying to ignore the land the trail crossed\", and Loial has drawn in on himself. The land they ride across is charred and burnt but only in certain places. They all run east to west and are thicker in the middle than at the ends. Rand thinks of Whatley Eldin painting a cart and how the charred patches look as though \"someone had streaked it with a monstrous brush of fire\". The rest of the land also looks dead, \"though grass covered the ground and leaves covered the trees\". No birds or animals can be seen or heard and the rivers are empty of life. The water in the land is safe to drink but \"it tasted flat, as if it had been boiled\". When Rand looks at the sky, he sometimes sees unnatural clouds, \"The lines were too straight to be natural\", though he does not mention it to the others.\nMid morning, Loial stops riding and walks over to a tree. He begins to sing to it, though not like the Ogier treesongs Rand has heard before. The Talent for Treesinging is fading, Loial \"was one of the few who had the ability\", and that makes treesung wood even more rare. The song seems like \"pure song, music without words\" and as he sings, Loial touches the wood of the tree and the branch of the tree seems to respond to the touch. The song seems to be familiar to Rand, \"as if he should know it\". As Loial finishes singing, he holds \"a staff as tall as he was and as thick as Rand's forearm, smooth and polished\". Rand is surprised, \"I didn't know Ogier carried weapons\" but Loial tells him it is though \"this land was glad for a weapon to be made\".\nRand gives the order for them to start riding again to keep up with the Darkfriends. Later on in the day, Hurin tells them that there is something strange about the trail: \"It's like I'm remembering it, Lord Rand, instead of smelling it\". There are other trails of violence crossing their own trail, some seem to be so new that there should be some evidence of the violence done there but there isn't. There was one such patch just outside the hollow they had slept in, \"I could have sworn there were hundreds slaughtered right under my feet\". This sounds suspiciously like the slaughter of the villagers by the Trollocs in the other world.\nThey make camp in the evening and Rand is the first to stand watch. He thinks of Fain and hears a thin voice on the wind, \"It's never over, al'Thor\". For a while he forgets the strange land as he practices his sword forms, \"Parting the Silk. Hummingbird Kisses the Honeyrose\". He sits down again and keeps watch, going over his time so that the others don't have to be woken. He doesn't notice that a fog has rolled in and when he does, a man in black appears, cloaked in shadow. Behind the mask, fire is in place of eyes and Rand recognises him as Ba'alzamon. Rand thinks that he is in a dream, \"It has to be. I fell asleep, and...\", but Ba'alzamon laughs at him. He knows Rand's name and says that he has known \"every name you have used through Age after Age, long before you were even the Kinslayer\". He claims that they have been tied together since the First Moment, \"we are tied together as surely as two sides of the same coin\". Rand denies it, saying that the name Father of Lies is well suited to Ba'alzamon.\nBa'alzamon walks over to Loial and Hurin, saying that \"You find odd followers... You always did\". He mentions \"the girl who tries to watch over you\" who is Egwene but Rand confuses her for Moiraine. He claims again that Ba'alzamon is lying; \"even when you tell the truth, you twist it to a lie\". Ba'alzamon talks of the White Tower and how it \"means to use you like a hound on a leash\". He claims that he and Rand are so closely linked that they guide each other, though Rand once more denies it. Ba'alzamon says that they two have fought battles since the Creation but the Last Battle is coming and that if Rand dies, it will be finished, \"This time the Wheel will be broken whatever you do\". Ba'alzamon wants Rand to serve the Dark One but he refuses, \"I deny you, and I deny your power\".\nBa'alzamon tries to tempt Rand over to the Shadow with promises of immortality and shelter from the madness, \"The power can be yours, and you can live forever\". Rand refuses once more and Ba'alzamon causes the fog to catch fire and his \"sword glowed as if just drawn from the forge\". Rand hides in the Void and tries to cling to saidin in an attempt to block the pain from the burning. Suddenly, the fire is gone and so is Ba'alzamon; Loial and Hurin are still asleep and Rand thinks that he imagined it. Pain sears through his hand and he finds that his hand is branded with the heron from his sword. He wraps a kerchief around his hand and thinks to himself that he will not channel; that is what \"Ba'alzamon wanted to tempt him\" with and what \"Moiraine and the Amyrlin Seat wanted him to do\".\n",

Rand does not welcome Loial's concern over the injury.\nWhilst traveling, they come across a \"tapering column\" that they believe could be Artur Hawkwing's spire for his victory against the Trollocs despite the fact that it had been torn down many years before. As they ride closer, a bird is visible on the spire and Rand believes that it is Hawkwing's hawk. On closer inspection, they see that it is a monument for Trollocs and that the 'hawk' is actually a raven. Loial explains that he believes that the world they are in is \"just a shadow of the real world. In this world, I think, the Trollocs won\". The spire is a Trolloc creation and celebrates their victory over Hawkwing.\nThere is no time to contemplate this as Hurin thinks that he spots a woman. Rand thinks of the Ways and warns the party to be very careful, despite the fact that they haven't been so far.\nA scream is heard, although in a different direction from where the woman was last seen, and Rand immediately goes to find out what is happening. He finds a woman cornered by a creature, later found out to be a grolm. He tries to kill it by shooting an arrow in to its hide but this doesn't work, only angering the beast as it charges at him. At the woman's urging, he uses the void and shoots an arrow in to the beast's eye, thus killing it.\nThe woman rides to meet Rand and Rand notices that she is extremely beautiful. She mistakes him for a Lord and Loial and Hurin for his retainers. Due to her beauty, Rand stutters and stumbles over his words as he explains his actions; \"A man who will not die to save a woman is no man\". She introduces herself as Selene, from Cairhien, and explains that she is not from the strange world; she entered it like Rand, Loial and Hurin did. Selene agrees to follow Rand and Hurin explains that they are after \"Darkfriends and Trollocs, my Lady\", as well as the Horn of Valere.\nThey ride, with Hurin following the trail, and Rand and Selene talk. Selene soothes Rand's heron mark injury while they talk about power. She says that \"Some men... choose to seek greatness, while others are forced to it\" and asks which one Rand will be, since sounding the Horn will give him power. This reminds Rand of what Moiraine has told him and asks if Selene is Aes Sedai. Selene denies this strongly; \"I am not offended, but I'm no Aes Sedai\". After this, Selene rides with Loial and Rand is left alone to wonder how they have managed to travel so far; \"More than a hundred leagues in less than three days\".\nAfter Loial's conversation with Selene, he explains to Rand that she has told him that they are in another world. \"These worlds... are reflections of the real world, she says\". They also find out that \"The Pattern has infinite variations... and every variation that can be, will be\". After this, Loial rides with Hurin and Rand and Selene talk.\nSelene praises Rand's ability with the bow and he tells her about the void. She recognizes this and calls it the Oneness, telling Rand, \"You'll learn uses for it that you never suspected\". Rand questions how Selene knows all about the Portal lands and then Selene tries to convince him to follow her to another Portal Stone. Rand becomes slightly angry and tells her to find the Portal Stone by herself and get herself out through it. Selene maintains that she does not know how and stays with the group. However, the conversation is broken by the \"coughing grunt\" of a grolm, followed by others. They discover that grolm are following them, \"a small pack, but they have our scent it seems\".\n",

Rand insists that he can kill the five grolm and leads the group up onto \"a low, round hill, bare of trees\". Using the void, Rand manages to slay each of the grolm by shooting it in the eye with an arrow. While Rand was still using the void, \"The light called to him, and he... reached... towards it\". This was an attempt to reach for saidin but he was interrupted by Hurin and the void shattered. Rand realizes that he feels alive when he reaches for saidin but the thought horrifies him; \"He wanted to go back into the void\".\nHowever, shortly after this, the group hears the barking of yet more grolm and Rand realizes that he can't slay all the grolm he will meet. He decides, at Selene's urging, to find the Portal Stone that Selene used to enter the Portal world; \"Lead us to this Stone, Selene\". Selene leads them to the Portal Stone, which is in a \"hollow nestled below them in the granite\". The group gather round the Stone and Rand seeks the void. Through the void, Rand is able to channel saidin in to the Portal Stone, \"He was one with the Portal Stone\".\nThe channeling allows the four of them to return to the real world. However, Rand's first thought is that he wants to continue to hold on to saidin but \"he let it go regretfully\". Selene tells him that what he did was \"remarkable\", transporting four people and their horses. Rand however, doesn't know what he did to activate the Portal Stone and asks Selene to not tell anybody about the Portal Stones since he doesn't \"understand it, and neither will anybody else\". Selene promises to keep it a secret.\nThere is a problem though because Hurin has lost the scent of Fain and the Trollocs and Rand fears that they have lost them for good. Selene then explains that some events \"have a shadow of that reflection even before the event occurs\" and so they have been tracking where the Trollocs are going to be.\nRand then wishes to send Selene back to Cairhien but she refuses, saying, \"A few days will see if I'm right\". She then reminds Rand of the power the Horn will give him but he \"doesn't want anything to do with legends\". They then decide to find a camp before darkness falls and while they are riding, Hurin promises that \"I'll never sleep again without first seeing what kind of stone there is nearby\". The plan for the following days is to find where they left the trail and wait for Fain and/or Ingtar and the others.\n",

She returns to the cabin and Nynaeve tells her that \"we'll reach Tar Valon today\". The two women then talk about the dreams that Egwene has been having; she believes that \"Rand is in some kind of danger\". Anaiya Sedai has apparently taken interest in Egwene's dreams since \"she knows there is something in these dreams\". It appears that Egwene is dreaming of Ba'alzamon as she describes a \"man in the mask\" who has fire instead of eyes.\nThe Amyrlin visits the cabin and gives the girls their lesson of the day. Although Egwene is eager to learn, Nynaeve wants to go on to the deck for the duration of the lesson but her seasickness prevents this. The Amyrlin has been told that Nynaeve has a temper \"like a fisher-bird with a bone in its throat\" but agrees that she should be an Accepted rather than a novice. The Amyrlin shows them a sword and a knife made of Air when Nynaeve says that she would rather be taught how to use a sword than channel.\nAfter this, Nynaeve loses her temper and describes her frustration of doing simple things, \"Light the candle, Nynaeve. Now put it out. Light it again\". The Amyrlin then shows them how to stop someone by binding them using Air. She does this to Nynaeve and lifts her in to the air for a punishment. However, Nynaeve learns the weaves quickly and binds the Amyrlin using Air. The Amyrlin then cuts Nynaeve off from the Source, something she didn't know could happen. Then, the Amyrlin lets go of her own weaves and the lesson continues.\nThe lesson went well for Egwene, although the Amyrlin \"had coaxed out every last drop of effort\". She can now produce a flame that will \"dance from fingertip to fingertip\". The lesson did not go so for Nynaeve as she refused to let her anger get the better of her and so couldn't channel. The Amyrlin tried many different ways to make her angry but this didn't work.\nAfter the lesson, the ship arrives at Tar Valon and everybody leaves the ship, leaving Nynaeve and Egwene to leave the ship on their own. Once they are off the ship, Sheriam Sedai, Mistress of Novices, meets them. She tells them that the White Tower and the Shining Walls were built by Ogier, \"Their best work ever, some say\". She warns them that some novices \"break under the strain\", which doesn't make either woman more confident. Nynaeve is also warned that \"the first few weeks of being one of the Accepted is one of the hardest periods. With this, Sheriam Sedai leads Egwene and Nynaeve to the White Tower.\n",

Rand refuses because he is afraid of the dagger that is stored in the chest along with the Horn. Selene tries to convince Rand to get rid of the dagger but Rand remains strong. Since \"Aes Sedai (are) trying to make me do what they want\", he once more asks Selene if she is Aes Sedai because of that resemblance. Once more Selene becomes angry at the suggestion, \"Aes Sedai! Always you hurl that at me!\", and refuses to talk to Rand and \"wrapped herself in a silent coldness\".\nThe group set up camp for the night and Selene appears \"to have regained some of her temper\" as she talks with Loial and Hurin, though rarely to Rand. However, \"whenever he looked at her, she was watching him and smiling\".\nAt the end of the next day, they see \"the village ahead, lights already twinkling\" and Rand suggests that they sleep in the village inn. Loial and Hurin agree with Rand but Selene wants to sleep under the stars instead of in Tremonsien. Rand argues that she won't enjoy it if Fain and the Trollocs surprise them but Selene argues that \"If Fain catches us, you will deal with him\". She also says that they will be in danger if the villagers discover that Rand has the Horn and this time, Loial agrees with her. Rand's solution is to throw a blanket over the chest and it becomes \"my Lady's chest of clothes\".\nWhen they start riding again, Rand spots \"something very large, by the light it threw up\" and rides over to see what it is. He finds a very large pit with armored men apparently guarding the site. He sees \"a gigantic hand holding a crystal sphere\" which is apparently attached to the statue of a man whose face \"thrust out of the soil with the dignity of vast years\". This reminds him of the \"giant hand holding a huge crystal sphere\" on the island of Tremalking that Bayle Domon told him about.\nRand summons the void unconsciously as \"saidin sang to him\". In the crystal he sees light that swirls like saidin and the sphere pulses. Selene warns him to get away from the edge of the cliff but Rand pays no notice to her, intent on the calling of saidin. Although he tries to let go of the void, it stays in place. Rand then begins to mumble something; \"Till shade is gone... till water is gone... into the Shadow with teeth bared... to spit in Sightblinder's eye... on the last day\". The cliff he is standing on crumbles beneath his feet and he scrambles on to safe ground, trance broken. The others didn't hear what he said but urge him to leave quickly since \"those guards have finally noticed us\".\nThey ride into the village of Tremonsien and find the inn, called The Nine Rings and decide to stay there. Selene seems unsettled and admits that \"You terrified me... and I do not frighten easily\", referring to Rand's trance by the statue. Once more she talks of the glory of the Horn but once more, Rand protests that \"The Horn is not mine\". Upset with that answer, Selene \"turned her back on him, her white cloak walling him off\".\n",

After some polite conversation about where they are from and where they are headed they are shown to a table. The meal they are served is oddly spiced Rand thinks but he definitely enjoys it. Selene on the other hand doesn't seem to have much of an appetite.\nAfter the meal the innkeeper, who has noticed the flute-case asks Hurin if he wants to play the flute for the other guests in the common room. She assumes Hurin to be Rand's servant and is quite convinced that Lords such as Rand don't play. When Rand says the flute is his, Maglin is very surprised. Rand hasn't practiced for a while but he still manages to play somewhat decent. The company of soldiers visiting the inn even join in when he plays a familiar tune. Even if the words are different from the ones he knows.\nThe captain of the company, Aldrin Caldevwin, gestures to his men to shut up and joins Rand's company at his table. He apologizes for his men but Rand says he didn't mind in the least. Like the innkeeper the captain is puzzled by Rand's company. He notices Rand's heron-marked blade instantly. When Rand tells him he is from Andor the captain makes a false statement about Gareth Bryne to check this. Selene doesn't seem to be too happy by the attention Rand is attracting and goes up to her room. Again she surprises the innkeeper by asking for a room for herself.\nAfter Selene leaves the conversation between Rand and the captain continues. Rand asks about the crystal sphere they saw on their way to the inn. The captain says it is part of a statue left over from the Age of Legends his men are excavating on the King's orders. The captain wants to know how long they will be staying. Rand answers they will leave in the morning. The captain offers to escort them to Cairhien since he is heading that way as well. Rand accepts and the captain retires for the night.\nRand's company decides to follow the captain's example. When Rand tells the innkeeper he will be sharing a room with Loial and Hurin she tells him whatever trouble he is having with his lady, it will certainly look better in the morning. Rand is so surprised by this he doesn't correct the innkeeper.\nAfter the innkeeper leaves them Rand, Loial and Hurin discuss captain Caldevwin's behaviour for a bit. Hurin explains that in Cairhien everybody plays the great game or Daes Dae'mar in the Old Tongue. Hurin doesn't seem to know a lot about it and Loial claims not to understand the ways of humans.\nWhen they get up in the morning Selene is gone. She left Rand a note saying there were too many people around and that she will find him again in Cairhien. Fifty Cairhien soldiers await them outside, ready for the trip to the capital. The captain is very surprised to hear Selene already left. Hurin whispers in Rand's ear he had the inn watched and the captain's men didn't see her leave.

She is looking for pieces of the puzzle surrounding Rand but she's not making any progress. Frustrated with her lack of progress she turns to her Warder and another problem she must deal with. They talk briefly about how they met and how they got to be bonded. Moiraine asks him if, after all these years, his bond chafes. Not really knowing where Moiraine wants to take this conversation Lan tells her that he accepts the bond without reservations still.\nMoiraine now tells him she has made arrangements so that in the event of her death the bond will pass to another Aes Sedai, Myrelle of the Green Ajah. He will feel compelled to seek her out. Lan is upset by this, this is the first time Moiraine has felt the need to use the Bond to compel Lan to do anything. He feels he is being treated as a pet, or worse still a package to be handed over to whomever he will fit best with. Despite Lan's anger Moiraine refuses to undo it though, she can hand him over to any sister she wishes and there is nothing he can do about it.\nInstead she returns to the original question. Does the bond not chafe? Lan gets even more upset now. He wants to know if this is all some kind of test to see if he is loyal. Not a test, Moiraine replies, but after events in Fal Dara she does wonder where his loyalties lie. Lan takes this to be a reference to Nynaeve. To keep him off balance Moiraine moves to an unexpected topic. Why did Lan tell Rand how to behave towards the Amyrlin? Lan doesn't really have a good answer. He suggests it may be the fact that Rand is a ta'veren. Moiraine can't deny that possibility. She dismisses a still very angry Lan so she can be alone to think.\nMoiraine thinks about the changes in Lan that Nynaeve caused. She notices he is starting to share some of her loyalties and objectives and wonders if Lan will be quite so willing to risk his life in the future. Putting the matter aside for the moment she returns to her studies.\nVandene comes in with a pot of tea for Moiraine since her Warder is practicing with his sword. Apparently Lan's presence has reminded Jaem that he is more than a gardener and handyman. The two Aes Sedai talk for a bit about Moiraine's studies. Moiraine asks Vandene some questions about several topics she has been looking at. Is there a connection between the Horn and the Dragon Reborn other than that the Horn must be found before the Final Battle? Vandene tells her there is none. Is there a link between the Dragon and Toman Head. Vandene and her sister have different ideas on that. Vandene seems to think the Dragon Reborn will appear somewhere above Toman Head based on a questionable translation from the Old Tongue. Her sister Aldeleas disagrees. Moiraine jumps to Shadar Logoth and Lanfear but Vandene can't offer her any useful information on either topic.\nAfter some speculation on the Dragon Reborn, Vandene has noticed the signs, she leaves Moiraine. The Blue sister decides to go for a walk in the garden to escape from all the unanswered questions. She hears someone behind her in the garden but assumes it is Lan. Too late she realizes she is being followed by a Draghkar, Shadowspawn that will suck the soul out of its victim. Unable to reach for saidar, Moiraine is defenceless against the creature. Then Lan and Jaem show up and kill the creature with their swords. The death cry of the Draghkar wakes up the whole village. In no time Vandene and Aldeleas are outside with lanterns. Aldeleas quickly sends Jaem to tell the villagers they don't know what made the noise but that they are all right while the others dispose of the body. The Aes Sedai wondered how it got so close undetected and Moiraine realizes the creature must have been shielded. A Black sister must have been involved. It's time for her and Lan to leave.\n",

                    "Summary": "Nynaeve is waiting in a room beneath the White Tower to take the Accepted test. She is slightly irritated at first having to wait for no apparent reason and now being rushed. The Mistress of Novices has explained to her what she should know for the test. In the room a big ter'angreal, a remnant of the Age of Legends is glowing faintly in the dark. The ter'angreal is shaped like three big arches and seems to be made out of one piece. Nynaeve must walk through the arches three times and face her fears. She will remember very little of her life in the real world. Once for what was, once for what is and once for what will be. Falter along the way and she will be put out of the Tower.\nNynaeve is also told that some people don't come back. They just disappeared after the ter'angreal was quieted down. Informed of the task she must perform and the risks attached Sheriam asks her for the last time if she is ready to take the test. She is allowed to refuse three times without being put out of the Tower. Thinking of how Moiraine turned the lives of Egwene, Rand, Perrin and Mat upside down she steels herself and proclaims she is ready.\n\"The way back will come but once, be steadfast.\" With those last words of advice Nynaeve steps through the arch. She finds herself, naked as the day she was born, in a strange sort of labyrinth. Obviously she is not going to find the exit by standing there so she starts walking. There is no indication of where the exit might be and Nynaeve gets frustrated by her lack of progress. Then she sees something moving from the corner of her eye. When she turns around there is nothing but she sees movement somewhere else now. She is convinced someone is following her and starts running. Then a very old-looking man steps out of the next corridor in front of her. He is Aginor, one of the Forsaken. Nynaeve becomes acutely aware of her nakedness when he says he'll enjoy her. She tries to run away again but Aginor follows her. Nynaeve now gets very angry and reaches for the source. She calls lighting down on a very surprised Aginor. He responds in kind but he is no match for Nynaeve's anger. She feels his resistance is weakening. Then the arch appears. The way back comes only once. Very frustrated she lets the Forsaken go and steps in to the arch.\nMemories come crashing back into Nynaeve as she steps through the arch. A relieved Sheriam takes her through the next step of the ritual. Nynaeve demands to know if what she's experienced inside the ter'angreal is real but Sheriam can't answer that question. She is very surprised to learn Nynaeve could channel inside the ter'angreal. Most people don't remember they can in the first place and it is a dangerous thing to do. Nynaeve is warned not to do it again.\nWhen Nynaeve steps in to the arch for a second time she finds herself in the Two Rivers. It's not the village she left behind though, she sees traces of neglect everywhere. Determined to have a word about this with the Mayor Bran al'Vere she sets out to the Winespring Inn. On the way she meets Cenn Buie who is even more unpleasant than usual towards her. Arriving at the inn she meets Marin al'Vere. She looks years older than Nynaeve remembers her. Marin wants to know if she brought Egwene back. Nynaeve can't exactly remember where Egwene is, but she knows the girl isn't with her. Marin tells her about the state of the village. The new Wisdom, Malena, turned out to be a bully. She is not afraid to use poison to kill people or driving people to suicide to get her way. Marin accuses the new Wisdom of murdering her husband, among other things, and bullying the men into electing Cenn in his stead. The village lives in fear of her. A furious Nynaeve sets out to confront the new Wisdom but when she leaves the inn the arch appears. Nynaeve is torn between helping her village and Marin, who begs not to leave her alone, and returning to the Tower. She chooses the Tower and steps through the arch.\nA crying Nynaeve again demands to know if what she has seen is real, knowing she will not get an answer. Sheriam is sympathetic but also tells her the third time is worst of all. Stopping now would mean being put out of the Tower, Nynaeve has no choice but to go on.\nStepping through the third arch she finds herself in Malkier. Lan is with her but she feels something is not right. A confused Lan asks if everything is well with his Queen and the mother of his children. Nynaeve can't bear this last test and wants to leave immediately. Lan is seriously worried  of th about her now. He asks her where she wants to go. Finally Nynaeve sees the arch and sets out for it. Lan follows her. For a moment she is tempted to stay but telling a very upset Lan all of it is not real she steps through the arch. Lan calls after her. \"Please don't leave.\"\nAgain Nynaeve is in tears. She proclaims she hates all Aes Sedai. Sheriam tells her this is a quite common response for women who just passed the Accepted test. Examining Nynaeve's hands, she finds two long black thorns driven through her palms. Healing will not remove all the scars even though, according to Sheriam, it should have. Nynaeve now notices that the Amyrlin has arrived to complete the ritual. She is now Nynaeve al'Meara, Accepted of the White Tower.\n",

From a distance they can see the strict layout of the city, the city walls forming a perfect square. Within the city walls towers rise up in a strictly ordered grid. Rand can see the famous Topless Towers of Cairhien from the distance. Outside the city walls the Foregate stretches out.\nThe soldiers clear a way for them as they move through the Foregate. Hurin explains to Rand that most of the people living there moved away from their farms near the Dragonwall during the Aiel War, a subject the Cairhienin are still very sensitive about. They didn't move back when the war ended leaving the city with a huge new population they couldn't accommodate within the city walls and the country with a severe shortage of grain. This is still being imported from the south in large quantities. To keep the population of the Foregate happy the King provides entertainment for free.\nWhen they get to the gate a clerk writes down Rand's name in a ledger and tells them they have to come back the next day to tell him the name of the inn where they are staying. Rand inquires after Selene but at the gate they haven't seen her but they'll keep an eye out for her. Even here the Great Game is being played and it makes Rand uncomfortable.\nTavolin and the soldiers leave them and Hurin takes them to an inn named the Defender of the Dragonwall he remembers from previous visits to Cairhien. The innkeeper is startled at Rand's appearance at first, taking him for an Aiel but as soon as he notices Rand's fine clothes he recovers. They take two rooms with a connecting door. When they have settled in Rand decides to go back to the Foregate for a bit. Loial doesn't want to go, he's afraid of meeting other Ogier, and Hurin settles for a drink in the common room.\nWhen Rand and Hurin go down three invitations from noble Houses have arrived for him. Rand refuses to play Daes Dae'mar and throws them in the fire while proclaiming this to the visitors of the inn. Hurin winces and tries to explain to Rand this will obviously have undesirable effects. A still angry Rand walks out of the inn in the direction of the Foregate.\nIn the Foregate he sees lots of entertainment in the streets and inns. The Great Hunt of the Horn is recited in many places. It reminds him uncomfortably of Thom. Then he hears a familiar voice retelling a tale from the Hunt of the Horn. Rand moves closer to the dais and sees Thom performing. Thom recognizes him and gestures to a door. Rand goes to meet him in a corridor behind the dais. Thom tells him the Fade wasn't all that interested in him and left him wounded instead of killed. He still limps because of it. He also wants to know if Rand still has his harp and flute. Thom has to go back on stage again so there isn't much time to talk. He tells Rand the name of the inn he is staying in and says he'll be there in an hour. He also tells him to bring his instruments.\n",

His thoughts drift to the Aes Sedai that seems to have them all on strings and then to Shienar, the land his companions come from. He realizes though, that he is supposed to keep watch as well. Perrin briefly considers seeking out the wolves in the region to see if there is anything wrong but he pushes that thought away quickly.\nJust as Perrin spots the rider they are waiting for Masema sees a raven. Before it can get away Perrin brings it down with his bow. The raven might report to a fade. Better to not take chances. The Shienarans can see the rider now as well and a little later Perrin leads them out of the thicket they used for cover to greet her.\nAfter the password is exchanged the woman introduces herself as Leya. She is one of the Traveling People. Perrin asks her how she found them but she gives him the answer all others have given him. She knew that if she came this way she would find someone to take her to the woman she wants to talk to.\nThere is very little talk on the way back to their camp. Leya and Perrin talk about the pacifist philosophy of the Traveling People for a while, Perrin wonders how long the strength of her belief will hold up against a Trolloc. Leya is convinced the Way of the Leaf is right though. She notices Perrin's unease with his own weapons. Perrin refuses to get into that.\n",

She refuses Perrin's offer of a hot meal asking only that her horse, Piesa, will be looked after. Perrin greets the other people and goes to find himself some supper.\nMin walks up to him looking at the Tinker woman. Perrin asks what she sees around the woman and Min predicts her violent death. Perrin asks if she is sure and Min explains a bit about her talent. She sees images around people but not all the time and not around everybody. She doesn't always know what they mean or when something is going to happen but they are always true. Perrin realizes that a violent death of the Tinker woman could mean an attack on the camp. For a second time that day he considers contacting the wolves in the area to see if there is any danger. And again he pushes that thought away. Instead Perrin asks Min not to tell him what she sees around him.\nLoial joins them and picks up talk about the Tuatha'an. Min quickly tells him what she's seen around Leya. Not for the first time this winter they wish they hadn't been caught up in this adventure. Loial concludes that few choices around ta'veren are your own. He still considers himself lucky to have been around three of them at a time. He is even taking notes to write a book about recent events.\nThey see Rand coming out of Moiraine's hut. He has been arguing with her all day. Perrin sees the Shienarans treat him like he is a King. Rand disappears through a crack in the rock wall around the valley that leads to an even more secluded valley. Rand always goes there after his arguments with Moiraine. Perrin follows him. Rand needs someone to talk to after these arguments.\nHe finds Rand reciting a part of the prophecies of the Dragon. He turns to Perrin and asks if he thinks Mat is all right. Mat must be in Tar Valon by now to the receive healing he needs. Perrin asks him if Rand wishes he were still a sheepherder. Rand mutters a Shienaran saying about duty and says there isn't really anybody else who can do it. Perrin turns the conversation to Moiraine now. Rand tells him they have been arguing about the same thing. The people who have declared for him on the Almoth Plain, the fighting and dying that is going on in his name and the fact there is nothing he can do about it. Rand knows she is right about that but he needs to vent his frustration.\nRand then speaks of saidin and how it pulls him. He wants to use it despite the taint but he has very little control over it. What will happen if the last battle is upon them and he can't reach the Source? The ground starts trembling under Perrin's feet. Apparently Rand has found the source this time. He unleashes a small earthquake before he gets hold of himself again. Saidin filled him he says, and he needed to direct it somewhere before it burnt him to a crisp. Looking around at the damage he caused Rand adds he didn't mean to do that. Perrin tries to get him to return to the camp with him for supper but Rand wants to be alone for a while. Perrin returns to the camp alone.\n",

Moiraine doesn't debate it with him but she is obviously upset. Perrin sees the damage Rand caused everywhere around them when he walks through the camp towards one of the fires.\nHe finds Min stirring a pot of stew half of which was spilled by Rand. He asks her if anybody has been hurt. Min tells him that besides some bruises, everybody is fine. Whatever Min saw regarding Leya probably hasn't happened yet. Perrin tells Min she doesn't have to stay here. He'll help her get away. He is puzzled by her reply. She refuses to go even if she thinks he is very sweet for offering. This fate may not be the one she would have chosen herself but she doesn't think it is bad because of that.\nMoiraine joins them at the fire and Min asks if the Tinker woman is all right. Moiraine says she split her scalp in the quake but that she has been Healed and is resting now. Is that what Min saw? She doesn't seem to know herself. Perrin is shocked by Moiraine's acceptance of Min's viewing but the Aes Sedai tells him the Wheel weaves as the Wheel will and that there is nothing they can do about it.\nLan, Loial and Uno join the conversation now and Moiraine tells them what she has learnt of events on Almoth Plain. Taraboners, Domani and Dragonsworn are still fighting each other and several Hunters of the Horn have taken an interest in Almoth Plain. What is most unusual though, is that the Whitecloaks have as many as five thousand men in the area. Although they had a few clashes with the Dragonsworn they seem to keep their distance from the larger groups. Still they claim to be looking for the 'false' Dragon on the plain. Loial suggests that it might be safe for Rand to go down to the Dragonsworn now but the others don't trust the Whitecloaks intention. What is even more worrying is that three tall light-eyed youths have been found dead without a trace of whoever was responsible. Uno seems to think this must be the work of the 'Soulless' but he doesn't explain what they are. Moiraine steers the conversation away from that topic.\nThe conversation turns towards their immediate safety now. Rand's action was a beacon for any Fade within ten miles so Moiraine is worried about a possible attack. There is a feeling in the air she says. Before Perrin realizes it he has described it as 'waiting'. Moiraine agrees with him. She tells Uno to make sure the guards are extra alert tonight. Other than that there doesn't seem to be a lot they can do. Perrin, who has third watch, goes to his hut to get some sleep.\n",

Perrin doesn't understand at first but the man means his axe. Perrin tells him he will but not yet. There is something dark about the man Perrin doesn't really trust. He talks about getting away from fate. He offers Perrin a drink that will help him see things more clearly. Perrin refuses and leaves the inn. As he leaves the man tells him he won't get many chances. Three threads are woven together, if one is cut all fall.\nPerrin feels a great heat from the room briefly. He turns around but the room is empty. Staring into a mirror he sees himself as a warrior now. In fine armour but with the plain axe at his side. Part of him accepts this image and another refuses it. He puts the image out of his mind firmly. As he does so a woman's voice tells him he is destined for glory. He turns around and looks at the woman. She is so beautiful she makes all other women look clumsy by comparison. The woman talks to him about how he should reach out and grasp his destiny. Perrin tells her he just wants to be a blacksmith. She too offers him a drink but again he refuses. The woman leaves but promises she will always be in his dreams.\nThe scene changes and Perrin is dressed in plainer clothes this time. He finds himself on a stone bridge connecting two stone spires. In the distance he sees a woman in a white dress hurrying somewhere. A bit later he witnesses a meeting of three men. One of them tickles his memory but he can't quite remember where he saw him before... somewhere in an inn? The three start arguing and suddenly a huge ball of fire envelops them. Perrin ducks for cover and feels the heat of the blast. When he looks back up the whole bridge the men had been standing on has disappeared.\nPerrin tells himself it is only a dream and again the scene changes. He finds himself in an open space surrounded by huge columns of Redstone. In the open space he sees a crystal sword. Perrin knows it is somehow important. Callandor. He doesn't know where that name came from but that is what the sword is called. Perrin remembers now he's had this dream before. At that moment the wolves finally manage to contact him.

He tells her to get back inside and hide but she doesn't seem to hear him. Perrin tries to get to her but his path is blocked by several Trollocs. By the time he has cut his way through them a Fade has reached Leya. With casual ease the Fade kills the Tinker woman. An enraged Perrin now attacks the Fade while in his mind the wolves let him know they are coming. He kills the Fade and kneels down next to Leya but there is no time to mourn. The wolves call him back to the battle.\nThe wolf in Perrin takes over now. He loses all sense of the greater battle but only focuses on the next Trolloc he slays. And the next. And the next. Finally the Trollocs run, pursued by the remaining wolves. Perrin wants to join them. He feels the wolves kill the last Fade and howls with them in mourning of the wolves that perished.\nWhen he lowers his head Min is there asking him if he is all right. Lan saves him from answering the question Min no doubt has by praising him. He fought well tonight. An embarrassed Perrin tells Min Leya is dead and that he was too late to prevent it. Min says it wouldn't have made a difference.\nIn the meantime, Masema sees in the fact that the wolves joined their fight a sign. He says they must go forth in the name of the Dragon Reborn. Uno quickly shuts him up by saying they are not going anywhere till Rand says so. He also suggests skinning the wolves for their hides but Perrin insists they be buried with the human dead. Nobody dares to argue with him.\nPerrin wants to know where Rand is. Min says he doesn't want to talk to anybody, but Perrin goes to see him anyway. Rand tells him how he tried to use saidin to kill the Trollocs and that he couldn't get hold of the Source at first. When he did he couldn't do anything useful with it. Rand says he was no use in that battle whatsoever. Perrin tries to make him feel a bit better but without much success.\nLan and Moiraine join them to see to their wounds. Perrin's are not that bad. Moiraine Heals them for him. Min refuses Healing, she doesn't have any wounds worth mentioning. Rand holds his side though. He has not been involved in the fighting but the wound he took at Falme burst open again. Moiraine tries to Heal him as well. After she has done as much as she can she passes out from exhaustion.

Perrin thinks the signs of religious madness in Masema are disturbing.\nWhen he arrives at Moiraine's hut he finds Moiraine, Loial and Min there already. He shares his opinion on Masema with the others but of course there are more important matters to discuss. Moiraine doesn't know yet how Rand left but the guards didn't see him go. Rand left a cryptic message mentioning his dreams. Moiraine is worried about Rand, she doesn't believe he is ready to face all the dangers the world holds for him. Perrin and Moiraine get in a decidedly unpleasant conversation about the Forsaken.\nWhen the conversation comes back to dreams again, Uno and Lan enter. Moiraine wants to know what dreams Perrin has had. He reluctantly describes them. Moiraine immediately recognizes the Stone of Tear and Callandor from what Perrin tells her. She sends Lan and Uno out to ask about the dreams the other men in the camp had. People strong in spirit can force their dreams on others. While Lan is gone she tells them about how drawing Callandor, the sword that is not a sword, the sword that cannot be touched, is an important part of the prophecies. The prophecies say the Stone of Tear will not fall until the Dragon holds Callandor. The Tairens, who want nothing to do with the One Power, placed Callandor in the Stone to prevent the Dragon from taking it. Rand will have to solve this paradox.\nLan returns with news that almost all the men in the camp shared at least part of Rand's dream. Moiraine now knows which way Rand is heading. Uno reports the valley where Rand caused an earthquake now has another exit. He most likely left that way. Moiraine tells Uno to get his men to Ghealdan and the name of a contact there. They are in no condition for a hard ride. She tells Min to carry a message to the Amyrlin Seat for her. Min first refuses but after Moiraine insists she promises to go. The Aes Sedai asks Loial and Perrin to join her. They agree to do so.\nMoiraine sends them all out of the hut to make preparations. Min asks Lan if he has a message for Nynaeve. He says he doesn't, to Min's surprise. She tells Perrin after he had made the decision to go with Moiraine she had a viewing about him. She saw a caged Aiel man, a Tinker with a sword and a falcon and a hawk, both female. She doesn't know what it means.

Moiraine leads them to the nearest inn where a man named Simion tells them they had a bunch of weddings the previous day. Enough for a lifetime. Perrin is about to ask Simion if he's seen Rand but Moiraine cuts him off and asks to be taken to the innkeeper.\nThe innkeeper, Master Harod, tells Simion to take them to his best rooms. He also indicates there has been some trouble with Whitecloaks. Moiraine asks Simion about this when they arrive at her room. Simion tells about how a group of Whitecloaks behaved very oddly not a day ago. The chain of command broke down and some actually ran off while others demanded to burn the town.\nWhen Simion takes Perrin to his room he asks about Rand. Rand has passed through the village and even spent half of the night at the inn before he went off into the night like the Dark One was on his heels. Simion thinks Rand was mad. Perrin tells him they mean to find him and help him. This confirms Simion's belief Moiraine is Aes Sedai. He's seen Aes Sedai before. He asks Perrin if she would try to help his brother. Perrin promises to ask and goes to look for Moiraine, leaving Simion with Loial.\nMoiraine is not pleased about Perrin asking for Rand. She has seen the signs of a ta'veren passing through the town. The weddings and the Whitecloaks' behaviour are all the proof she needs. Lan suggests killing Simion to make sure he doesn't talk but Moiraine doesn't think that is necessary this time. She agrees to see Noam.\nSimion takes Perrin and Moiraine to a shed where Noam is locked up. Noam turns out to be a wolfbrother like Perrin. But it seems Noam has turned into a wolf completely. Moiraine looks for any trace of humanity in Noam but can't find it. She can't help him. Knowing this could ultimately be his fate. Perrin sets Noam free so he can die like a free wolf, not a caged one.\n",

His condition is worsening fast. He needs to be healed in Tar Valon soon or Nynaeve fears he'll die. With Dragonmount rearing up in the distance everybody is getting eager to reach the end of their long journey, their tempers are short and the company is uneasy.\nDreams have been troubling Egwene again lately. Nynaeve's weather sense tells her a storm is coming\u2014but of late her weather sense seems more related to people than to the weather. Hurin is worried about some track he saw in the past few days, sniffing a trail he's unsure of. Only Verin seems composed even though she is hip deep in matters of the real world. Very unusual for a Brown.\nSuddenly Nynaeve spots a band of Whitecloaks. Knowing the Whitecloaks will not be friendly to Aes Sedai, Verin tells them to let her do the talking. The leader of the Whitecloaks demands to know where they are coming from and the conversation quickly turns unfriendly. When the Whitecloaks threaten to take them to the Questioners for interrogation, Elayne can hold her tongue no longer and makes herself known. She demands that they let the company past or they'll have Queen Morgase to answer. The Whitecloaks are not impressed, suggesting that the Queen is not as close to Tar Valon as she once was.\nThe leader raises his hand as if to signal his man to attack. Egwene, thinking back of her experiences with the Seanchan, has had enough. She opens herself to the One Power and frightens the leader with a fountain of earth exploding in front of his horse. Elayne and Nynaeve join her much to Verin's astonishment. The leader falls off his horse and the rest of the Whitecloaks make a run for it.\nVerin severly repremands Egwene, Nynaeve and Elayne for disobeying her. Egwene tries to apologize to the Whitecloak and tells him they had a long journey from Falme. After hearing that name the Whitecloak explodes and yells at them that he is Dain Bornhald and Aes Sedai killed his father at Falme. Again Verin is very displeased with Egwene for not guarding her tongue. They leave the Whitecloak where he is and travel on in the direction of Tar Valon, where, according to Verin, \"the real danger begins\".\n",

She wonders if the Aes Sedai will tell him that. Mat is not very receptive to Selene's offer and she starts to lose her patience. Just as Selene loses her patience she seems to hear something in the corridor. She leaves quickly promising to return and tells Mat to consider his options carefully.\nA few moments after Selene's departure the Amyrlin and the Keeper step into the room. They've come to see how he is doing. Mat assures them he's ready to be on his way. The Amyrlin knows better and the Keeper points out he can barely stand up. They tell him he needs a lot of food for days yet. Mat replies he is fine and not hungry at all. He really should be going. The Aes Sedai don't believe him and tell that if anything he should at least stay as a precaution. They can't be sure yet if they removed all the evil from Shadar Logoth from him. Besides, his description has been passed to the guard. He won't be able to leave Tar Valon.\nTo see if Selene was right Mat remarks his parents probably think he's dead. The Amyrlin offers to make sure a letter reaches them but won't say more. Only when Mat remarks he wouldn't put it past his father to come looking for him the Amyrlin tells him he and Tam al'Thor have indeed been to Tar Valon. Mat is getting very suspicious now and inquires after Rand. The Amyrlin seems to think this is a dangerous topic and asks the Keeper to get Mat some more food. The Amyrlin makes it clear some topics are too dangerous to talk about, even in the Tower. Rand is one, the Horn of Valere is another. She tells him he is tied to the Horn for as long as he lives. Only he can summon the heroes to fight for him. But it will work for the Dark as well. They will try to get the Horn through Mat but if they can't, killing him is an option as well. The Amyrlin means to make sure he is at Tarmon Gai'don to blow the Horn for Rand. With that message she leaves, leaving Mat to consider his options. He is stuck in Tar Valon for the time being it seems, but he's still determined to leave as soon as he gets a chance.\n",

Egwene wanders the Brown corridors alone searching for Verin's study, noting the dusty feel of the air and the minimal decorations. She finds Verin's study cluttered with maps, books, strange instruments of glass and metal and skulls of various shapes and sizes, as well as a pet owl.\nEgwene finds Verin studying what she claims is perhaps the only page to have survived the Breaking, trying to decipher what Rosel of Essam had meant two hundred years after the Breaking when she said that it held secrets the world was not ready to face. The page is a High Chant the reads on about Ba'alzamon and how it is a name hidden within a name. The chant calls Ba'alzamon \"Betrayer of Hope\" and then names Ishamael the Betrayer of Hope. Neither Verin nor Egwene understands its meaning.\nVerin gives Egwene a folder of papers detailing the women who left the Tower with Liandrin, giving any details Verin could find on record, and a list and description of the ter'angreal they took. Verin says she sees no use in the information, and Egwene becomes suspicious that perhaps Verin is also Black Ajah. She waves the thought aside and tells Verin she trusts her.\nVerin then turns the conversation to Dreamers, telling Egwene she is the first Tower Dreamer since Corianin Nedeal four hundred and seventy-three years ago. Verin begins to explain what a Dreamer does to Egwene, drawing first a map of lines representing the Worlds that Might Be. She tells them how these worlds and their very lives are woven into the Pattern of an Age, and how those patterns are further interwoven into the Great Pattern. She then explains how some in the Age of Legends believed that there were still more worlds, overlapping all the Worlds that Might be, and that the Dark One and Creator exist in all worlds simultaneously.\n",

Sheriam disregards them and tells Egwene she is late for her test to be raised to Accepted. Sheriam leads her to the hall where the testing ter'angreal is located. Elaida snaps at Egwene when she enters for being late. Sheriam explains that novices are given three chances at taking the test, and if they refuse a third time they are permanently put out of the Tower. Elaida states that Egwene should not be given the chance to take the test, and Sheriam reveals that Elaida demanded to be part of the ceremony.\nEgwene says she will not refuse, and Sheriam warns her that once you begin you must finish or be put out of the Tower, and that to seek inside the ter'angreal is dangerous, that some women never came out. Egwene accepts the test and the ceremony begins. Egwene removes her clothes and worries about the women in the room reading the papers Verin gave her, or discovering the dreaming ter'angreal. She folds the papers and ring inside her clothes and sets them aside by the testing ter'angreal. As soon as she does, Alanna says that there is some sort of resonance, an echo inside the ter'angreal. Alanna tells Sheriam that it is not a problem, and the ceremony begins. After Sheriam and Elaida give the traditional introduction of the candidate, Egwene enters the first arch, the time for what was.\nInside the arch, she finds herself back in the Two Rivers, married to Rand and with a baby daughter named Joiya and studying to replace Nynaeve as Wisdom. Rand tells Egwene that the peddlers bring news of war, of everybody fighting the Seanchan, a people who use Aes Sedai in battle. Rand begins to get a headache, something that has happened more and more frequently, each time growing in pain and bringing strange occurrences. Egwene walks to Rand to attempt to Heal him, and the arch appears. She heads for it and the headache suddenly brings Rand to his knees in pain. He begins screaming for Egwene to help him ease the pain. Egwene tells herself she cannot help and runs through the arch.\nSheriam pours a chalice of water over Egwene's head, washing her clean of what she may have done. She asks Sheriam if what happens was real, and Sheriam responds that noone truly knows if it is real, but the danger is. Egwene then enters the second arch, the arch for what is.\nInside the arch, Egwene finds herself in a fine dress standing in the ruins of the Royal Palace of Andor. The whole city is in ruin, and band of men are running from patrols of Trollocs. A Myrddraal appears, leading the Trollocs in a hunt for some man. She enters the palace and finds Rand pinned beneath a heavy beam. She tells Rand that if she moves the beam, everything will come crashing down and kill them both. Rand says that he could move it himself, but he can't trust himself. He says that he is holding the madness at bay, but he fears that by letting go to move the beam the madness will take him. He tells her to help him by stabbing him in the heart with his dagger. Egwene asks why, and Rand tells her that if he is still alive when the Myrddraal find him they can turn him to the Shadow. The arch appears and Egwene runs to it as Rand screams for her to help him.\nAgain, Sheriam and Elaida wash Egwene clean. Egwene asks Sheriam if Myrddraal and Dreadlords really could have turned a person to the Shadow. Sheriam tells her that thirteen Dreadlords weaving flows through thirteen Myrddraal could turn a channeler to the Shadow, and Egwene notes that thirteen sisters, Liandrin and twelve others, left the Tower as she enters the final arch, the arch for what will be.\n",

The Amyrlin vows to find out what went wrong before leaving.\nSheriam gives Egwene the Great Serpent ring. Egwene thanks Elaida, and Elaida tells her that she did not want her brought forward because she is a wilder, a wilder in spirit and a wilder in ways and that it would have been far better for her to settle for learning how to stay alive. As Egwene is walking with Sheriam and asking what happened, Alanna joins them and tells her the reverberation came back a thousand fold, as if it was trying to shut them off from the Power. Alanna says she will seek punishment from the Amyrlin for not doing what she should have done. She tells Egwene that the only time she has experienced such a reverberation was when a ter'angreal was  used in the same room with another one in some way related to it.\nEgwene then asks Alanna what it means to be Green Ajah. Alanna explains that you must love men. She says that they are known as the Battle Ajah and stand ready to face the Shadowspawn armies at Tarmon Gai'don. The Amyrlin then joins the three women. The Amyrlin refuses to allow Alanna to work in the Kitchens, and tells her to talk to Sheriam if she desires punishment, and suggests Egwene get to sleep before leaving them.

He finds a way out and walks over to a group of guardsmen. Mat begins talking with one of the bridge guards, asking casually about conditions across the river. The guard informs him that there are Whitecloaks on both sides of the river, but it doesn't matter because a sister had come to the bridges the night before and drilled Mat's description into them and told them he was not to leave the city, let alone the island.\nMat leaves the guard and begins wandering the Tower grounds. He runs into a novice and recognizes her as Else Grinwell, though her manner and behaviour is totally unlike what he remembers of Else. She knows about his healing and tries to avoid him, thinking he may be contagious, and runs off to her work. As he tries and fails to follow her, he catches the sounds of the practice and yard and curiously decides to investigate.\nMat comes upon Warders watching over their students sparring with practice swords, and notices a crowd of Aes Sedai and Accepted watching two particular students spar. Mat realizes that the women are watching Gawyn and Galad practice just as the Warder decides to give them a quick break. Gawyn and Galad catch sight of Mat, and ask him if he's here to learn the sword. Mat replies that he is not and Gawyn says that everyone could do with knowledge of the sword. Mat says the he doesn't need the sword, that he could do fine against both of them with his quarterstaff.\n",

Egwene thinks about the two dreams she had, one of the Seanchan and another of Rand reaching for a strange crystal sword as a net fell over him. She dreamed of Rand walking into Shayol Ghul, and of Rand confronting the Seanchan. She had dreamed of Perrin with a falcon and a hawk, both of which Egwene is sure represent women, but the hawk was holding a leash and trying to fasten a collar around Perrin's neck. She also dreamed of Perrin with a beard, leading a pack of wolves. And of Mat, placing his eye on a balance and hanging by his neck from a tree.\nNynaeve growls that the information is useless, and wonders whether or not Verin purposefully gave them useless information. The only pattern Egwene notices is that all of the Ajahs, except the Red, of which Liandrin was the only one, lost two sisters each. Egwene states that everything is random, that none of them were born in the same city, no more than two in the same country, and that they went through a large age range. Egwene then realizes that it is too neat and that the Black Ajah must have had a wide variety to choose from to make so random a pattern and thus there must still be Black sisters in the Tower and elsewhere.\nEgwene notices that thirteen ter'angreal have been stolen, and more than half of them \"use unknown\", last studied by Corianin Nedeal. Four more have some connection to sleep. Another is a long black rod labelled \"DANGEROUS AND ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO CONTROL\" which produces balefire. The women seem suspicious that Verin had not noticed that more than half the stolen ter'angreal had last been studied by Corianin Nedeal.\nEgwene believes that Alanna cannot be Black Ajah, and Nynaeve thinks likewise about Elaida and Sheriam. Egwene decides to try the dreamer ter'angreal that night. As they discuss it, they notice Else standing in the door. Else gives them a message from the Amyrlin telling them what storeroom the stolen ter'angreal had been in. Afraid she cannot keep a secret, Egwene goes chasing after Else. She runs into a woman dressed all in silver and white, who Egwene notes as extremely beautiful, who tells Egwene that she is bold to be alone in the midst of so many murders. The woman tells Egwene that she saw Else running away down a nearby corridor and leaves. Egwene begins to head after Else but quickly turns back to find the women in silver and white has completely vanished.\n",

Nynaeve offers to go with her but after some discussion it is decided Egwene will go to Tel'aran'rhiod alone while the other two watch over her sleeping body. After all they don't know if the ring will work for two and there is plenty to look out for in the waking world.\nWhen Egwene falls asleep she finds herself in a hilly area, the landscape is beautiful and the place doesn't seem dangerous at all. But remembering Verin's warning she decided to be cautious anyway. After experimenting with the One Power to see if she can channel in the world of dreams she gets on her way. After taking a step forward she finds herself in an inn. Perrin is there, sleeping in a chair, accompanied by what seems to be a big dog. After a moment Egwene realizes it is wolf not a dog. The wolf gets ready to attack her. Perrin wakes up in time to see Egwene flee before the wolf attacks her.\nShe suddenly finds herself somewhere else. It's dark and she seems to be in a forest. The glow of a campfire is visible through the trees. She heads towards it and finds Rand at the campfire. She steps into the light. Rand doesn't seem to believe it is really her but rather someone sent by the Dark One to kill him. Apparently she isn't the only familiar face he has seen in his dreams. Egwene tries to channel to make him listen but he slices through her weaves easily and threatens her with a sword created with saidin. Egwene flees back to the hills were she started.\nEgwene now tries to focus on her mission. She concentrates on finding answers about the Black Ajah. Suddenly she is in a great hall filled with redstone columns. She meets an extremely ugly servant woman named Silvie there. Silvie talks about Ba'alzamon and the great crystal sword that can be seen in the Hall. Egwene notices that the sword, Callandor, is guarded by a complex weave made of both saidar and saidin. Then footsteps can be heard in the Hall. Someone is coming to look at the sword according to Silvie. Egwene should leave. When she tries though she doesn't seem to be able to get back to the hills. Silvie offers to help, she touches the stone ring and Egwene wakes up in agonizing pain.\nAfter Egwene has calmed down a bit she tells the others what she saw, leaving out only Perrin's wolf. The great hall and Callandor again point to Tear. There is nothing for it but to go there, spring the trap the Black Ajah is setting and see who they can catch. They agree that if the Amyrlin doesn't contact them before midday the following day they will leave. Elayne needs to send a message to her mother, Queen Morgase, though. She can't just run off without notice again. Nynaeve says she knows the perfect messenger.\n",

Nynaeve speaks about their lack of choice except to go to Tanchico, whilst Egwene answers that she is not convinced. The two Accepted - who are acting as Aes Sedai - are speaking of their hunt for the Black Ajah.\nJoiya and Amico, two Black sisters, are being held captive in the room, bound by Air and with their ears stopped up. A shield stops Joiya from touching the Source; there is no need for one with Amico - she has been stilled. When she is ungagged, Amico said that they should go to Tanchico, that there was something very dangerous to Rand there. Not a word had changed from what she had said during previous questionings. She is bound again, and then Joiya is unbound. The Black sister begins a speech on repenting her sins and the like, but Egwene does not believe a word of it. She commands Joiya to tell her tale, but using different words. The sister complies, and says that the Black Ajah intended to break Mazrim Taim - who is traveling to the Tower to be gentled - free, proclaim him the Dragon Reborn, and give his name as Rand al'Thor; and make him destroy the world a great deal. Nynaeve interrupts, saying that the Dragon was reborn, and that the Pattern would not accept another Dragon. Egwene, however, ushers the other woman to continue. Joiya begins speaking again. Rand al'Thor would be blamed for the things the impostor did. The countries would unite against him, crushing him, and he would be destroyed. Tarmon Gai'don would arrive, and the Dark One would win with no Dragon to face him.\nEgwene thinks about their two answers, and decides that Amico's is more plausible. At that moment, Moiraine strides in, her face a thunderhead, with Elayne following.\n",

                    "Summary": "Moiraine is angry with Rand and Elayne watches an exchange between the Aes Sedai and Nynaeve about how 'mule-headed' Two Rivers men are. Nynaeve is obviously satisfied that Moiraine is unable to influence Rand to do what she wishes. Elayne finds herself trying to head off the argument. Egwene asks Moiraine why she is so angry with Rand and instead of answering, Moiraine turns her attention to Joiya and Amico, whom Nynaeve and Egwene are in the process of questioning. Elayne is afraid of Joiya, who, she realizes, is not bound but is at least shielded from the True Source. She observes that Nynaeve and Egwene seem to be no more afraid of Joiya than Moiraine is and admits to herself that sometimes she finds it difficult to be brave and wishes she could be as bold as the others.\nElayne notices that for the first time Moiraine is not all cool and calm as normal and seems 'out of herself' and visibly needs to regain her composure. She is also aware that had it been Egwene or Nynaeve who were off balance, Joiya would have taunted them and tried to make them more upset, but with Moiraine, Joiya is plainly uneasy. Moiraine tells Joiya that she has made arrangements for her and Amico to be taken to Tar Valon in four days and threatens her with the Traitor's Court unless she can come up with something new to say. Amico seems to be terrified of Moiraine and once released from the bonds that had been holding her, drops to the floor in a curtsy in front of her. Nynaeve is angry with Moiraine for not taking more time to help question Joiya and Amico and because she has now decided to send them back to Tar Valon. Moiraine and Nynaeve argue. Nynaeve loses her temper with Moiraine telling her not to interfere in the task of chasing the Black Ajah that the Amyrlin has set them. Moiraine seems to be dangerously cool and looks as though she will teach Nynaeve a lesson about holding her tongue. Elayne feels that she has fallen into the role of peacemaker between the others. Elayne realises that she is, potentially, stronger than Moiraine, but that some of the things Moiraine does with the Power still amaze her. She is also aware that there are things that she, Egwene and Nynaeve can do that Moiraine cannot.\nElayne feels that she is betraying Egwene because of her feelings for Rand but she is upset because Berelain was in Rand's chambers. Moiraine apologizes to Egwene that she had to be told about Berelain. Egwene realizes how Elayne feels and admits to Elayne that she loves Rand like a brother and Elayne as a sister and wishes them well with each other. Elayne is surprised but relieved. Egwene shocks everyone by asking Moiraine if she has ever been in love. Moiraine then surprises them further by telling them she has a better idea who she will marry than either Egwene or Elayne. Moiraine then seems to regret speaking and tells them that she meant only to share an ignorance. She tells Nynaeve that she would not choose Lan.\nMoiraine and Elayne tell Egwene and Nynaeve that Rand had almost died when a bubble of evil passed through the Stone, but that he is Healed. She also explains that Rand cannot at the moment stop these things from happening but that in time he will be better equipped to deal with them. Elayne feels that Moiraine's reaction to the whole incident is cold. Moiraine is angry with Rand because he will not move on from Tear and that the Forsaken will see his inaction as a sign of weakness. She tells the girls that she wants Rand to go after Sammael and for Tear to go to war against Illian. Nynaeve does not agree with her but Elayne suddenly comprehends that sometimes unpleasant things have to be done because the price of not doing them is worse. Moiraine is sympathetic towards her over this. Elayne realizes what Nynaeve doesn't - that war will come anyway, whether Rand begins it or not. Nynaeve is visibly shaken by this and Egwene is horrified at the understanding. Moiraine tells them that Rand is reading all of the Prophecies of the Dragon to see what they say to help him decide what to do and that she is worried that one of the Forsaken will have him before he has made up his mind. Nynaeve is more gentle about it, explaining to Moiraine that he is only trying to find his way. Moiraine is not affected and tells the girls that she will do what she must. Egwene and Elayne demand that she tell them what she intends.\nMoiraine tells the girls about the Tairen Great Holding and the twisted doorway ter'angreal that is there. She tells them that she may step through it, but Elayne notices that she does not seem eager to do so. Nynaeve says that they had been there to see if Liandrin or the others had taken anything and Elayne says that she had seen the doorway when they were there. Elayne and Egwene immediately think of uses for it as soon as Moiraine tells them what it does. Moiraine is exasperated and tells them about the rules of using the doorway and the dangers. Nynaeve demands to know how Moiraine knows all this so she tells them how it used to be the property of the First of Mayene. Moiraine then advises the girls to concentrate on Tanchico and that she had sent pigeons to the Amyrlin and also reminds them of their status and then leaves them.\nElayne asks Egwene again if she meant what she said about Rand and that she often wondered if the jokes Min had made about them sharing him had been a viewing she hadn't told them about. She tells Egwene that she still believes that Rand is in love with Egwene. She is full of despair and thinks her mother will disapprove of him as well. Egwene tries to comfort her by reminding her about the reports of her mother's affair with Lord Gaebril. Nynaeve rejoins them and surprises them both by knowing exactly what they've been talking of and asking Elayne what she means to do about Berelain and if she's even sure she wants to go to the trouble because of what Rand will become. Elayne retorts that it doesn't matter and that she loves him regardless. Nynaeve is happy with her response and says she had to be sure. But still wants to know what Elayne plans for Berelain. Elayne declares she still doesn't know and she believes that Rand doesn't even know she exists. Nynaeve then asks what Elayne will do when they have to part, if Rand asks her to stay and she says she will still leave because she has duties and wants to become Aes Sedai. Elayne thinks the others would think her silly for worrying about Rand when they are searching out the Black Ajah and Nynaeve reassures her.\n",

Rand's quarters are being guarded by six Aiel and they ask admittance to investigate Rand's wounds. Gaul informs them that Rand is in a foul mood and has already thrown out a group of High Lords that morning and actually physically shoved Torean down the hall. Egwene sees this as a change in him. He was not usually a violent person. Once they enter his rooms Egwene looks for more changes in him and finds them. His once open face was harder and he looked much more like an Aiel. He thinks Moiraine has sent them. They tell him that she did not and they came to help him with channeling. Rand is suspicious but Elayne convinces him to at least give it a try. Egwene embraces saidar and asks Rand if he notices anything. He feels nothing and asks if she is really channeling and she is holding as much of the Power as she can manage. She rates her channeling against Moiraine's for the first time and realises that she is the stronger. Egwene then reaches out with the Power to Rand's wound and describes it as evil festering.\n",

He takes on a Fade right outside his door and shouts out battle cries in the hope of keeping the remaining Defenders of the Stone from fleeing and they begin to echo his shouts. Rand battles with the Fade and each time his Power-wrought sword meets the Fade's Thakan'dar blade lightning flashes from them. Eventually he begins to overpower the Fade and his blade shears the Fades in two. He kills the Fade also taking out the Trollocs that are bonded with it. The Defenders obey his commands about the injured and the care of their blades. This is the first time they have accepted his leadership, so he orders them to follow him, again shouting battle cries (which they also take up).\nHe leads the remaining Defenders through the Stone killing as many Shadowspawn as possible. Everywhere there is fighting in small groups. Some of the Aiel join him along the way. At one point he sees Moiraine and Lan and sees Lan get injured but can do nothing to help as he is swamped by Trollocs. By the time he is finished with them Moiraine and Lan are gone. He also notices that some of the battles going on are between men and those Darkfriends in the Stone that have sided with the Shadowspawn. He also sees Trollocs fighting Trollocs and assumes that the Myrddraal have lost control over them and their bloodlust has taken over.\nRand takes on a group of Trollocs, one of which falls trapping him as another advances on him. A fourth Trolloc splits the advancing Trolloc's head open and leaves Rand alone. Rand is astonished that a Trolloc appears to have saved him. Rand stops to watch two Fades fighting each other in the hallways. Lanfear appears behind him and pretty much admits that this conflict between the Shadowspawn is her doing. He uses the Power to pin her up against the wall but cannot remember how to shield her. She reminds Rand that he has left Callandor in his rooms and that anyone could take it. She then breaks his weaves and taunts him. He leaves her to run back to his rooms for Callandor. He is hesitant to use it but takes it up anyway. A Fade appears in the doorway and he reaches for saidin using Callandor. The Fade turns to flee but, without even realizing he had channeled he destroys it.\nHe then goes after the remaining Shadowspawn burning them all with the Power where they stand. Rand needs to do more, something to kill all of them. He raises Callandor and draws on the Source, he has no idea what he does but creates a spinning mass of light and it seems like a voice in his head is telling when to unleash it. Lightning from the mass goes shooting across the ceilings which strike down at all the Shadowspawn throughout the Stone. He can feel the lightning striking them down.\nMoiraine appears and also does not know what he did. She is shocked and lost for words, but seems to think there may be something wrong with Rand and keeps her distance. Rand sees a small girl dead and is so distressed he tries to bring her back to life using Callandor and the Power but it does not work and he begs for Moiraine to Heal her. She tells him she cannot Heal the dead but that she will see that the girl's body is taken care of. Rand is upset that he is too late to save them all. He then asks if his friends are alive and Moiraine tells him that they are. Lan explains that the Trollocs came in on grain barges and wagons and he is contemptuous that nobody thought to check why grain should be brought to the Stone. Rand tells Moiraine about Lanfear but she is not surprised, she tells Rand about Lanfear and Lews Therin's relationship. Moiraine Heals Rand and he finally tells her that he will decide his next move that night and tell her tomorrow.\n",

Aviendha sits on the floor, still fully armed after the attack. Egwene marks a candle with her thumb and tells them to wake her up as soon as it burns down to the mark. Egwene has a list in her pouch of all the ter'angreal that were stolen by the Black Ajah and some of them might give access to the World of Dreams. They recovered two from Amico and Joiya, but that meant eleven still remained, making Tel'aran'rhiod a very dangerous place.

She finds her way outside and walks through Tanchico, wondering why there are dogs and pigeons, but no horses, although there are lots of rats in the stables. She wonders if a Wise One would know and finds herself back in the Waste yet again. She is run over by the charging boar this time and when she scrambles to her feet, she finds the same Aiel woman from before looking at her.\nThe Aiel woman's spear is pointed at her and Egwene tries to make her lower it long enough so she can concentrate and get back to the palace, so she dresses herself in cadin'sor.

She concentrates to get her clothes back and fix the Aiel woman naked in her mind long enough for her to get back to Tanchico. She briefly glimpses a blonde woman with a silver bow before getting back.\nOnce back in Tanchico it is not long before the Aiel woman finds her again and introduces herself as Amys.\nIt is obvious that Amys knows much more about the World of Dreams and just before Egwene is pulled out she demands that Egwene come to her in Cold Rocks Hold.\n",

                    "Summary": "Perrin prepares to leave the Stone, thinking sadly that he hasn't stayed anywhere \"long enough to put down roots\" except the Two Rivers, which is now in danger. Gaul accompanies him down to the stables and tells him that he will be the only Aiel to accompany Perrin, \"they have seen more than they want of strange places\". He also tells Perrin that while they have made their leaving a secret, Faile has talked openly of travelling the Ways. Perrin is angry that she might have let Moiraine know what he is planning. Perrin asks Gaul to promise that \"if anything happens to me\"; Gaul will make sure that Faile is safe.\nWhen they reach the stables, Perrin learns that two Maidens of the Spear will be accompanying Faile, Chiad and Bain. Chiad is of the Clan Goshien and so there may be trouble between her and Gaul, \"Her clan and mine have blood feud\". The two Aiel are travelling with Faile because it is \"this argument between you and Faile which interests them\". Loial is in the stable too and is agitated because Faile insists on leaving very soon and he is worried that Perrin will be left behind. The group saddle up the horses and as they prepare to leave, \"the Stone rang like a monstrous bell, the stable floor leaping\". Perrin feels the \"pull of ta'veren to ta'veren\" but refuses to change his plans and rides out of the stable with Loial and Faile.\nThey ride out of the city, only slowing down to rest their horses and to wait for Gaul, Bain and Chiad to catch up. None of the Aiel would ride a horse, \"I offered to buy them horses, and they looked offended\", and so they had to run to catch up the group. While they wait, Faile wastes no time in trying to unsettle Perrin, \"He is very boastful about his eyesight... but his memory is not very good\". The Aiel join them very quickly, much to Faile's surprise. We learn from Bain and Chiad's taunting that Stone Dogs \"take their vows not to retreat\" and from Gaul that Maidens are commonly used as scouts.\nFaile insists that they set off to find the Waygate quickly and so they split into two groups, Perrin's and Faile's. While Perrin enjoys watching the herds of horses they pass as they\u200b ride, Loial is aghast that what was once an Ogier grove has been destroyed and what's left is only grass. He is especially upset that the Great Trees have gone, \"It is the trees we love\". Loial is extremely angry and Perrin understands why Ogier have been called \"implacable enemies\". Though Ogier are slow to anger, they are deadly when they are.\n",

                    "Summary": "Elayne and Nynaeve arrive at the docks after a rough ride in the carriage, \"How did you manage to find every last rut and hole between here and the Stone?\" The carriage has no sigil or house colours as no Tairen lord wants to be associated with Aes Sedai. The people they see at the docks have obviously been treated badly by the High Lords of Tear and Elayne has \"the urge to teach these folks dignity\". The Sea Folk raker is the largest ship there \"with three great towering masts amidships\" and from the tales of the Atha'an Miere, it offers the mystery of far lands and different people.\nNynaeve blames the driver for the bad journey and so Elayne pays him and gives him some praise before they leave; \"a kind word and a little praise were usually received as well as silver was, if not better\". After the servant has gone, Nynaeve chastises Elayne for giving him too much money, \"We do not have the Realm of Andor's resources for our own use\". As they walk to the raker, Elayne advises Nynaeve to be tactful so that she doesn't offend the crew. They spot two women on the ship \"who were obviously not ordinary crew\". Both women have pierced ears and a chain runs from their nose to their ear, with medallions hanging off the chain.\nThey approach the two women and, remembering what Moiraine has told them, introduce themselves formally. They introduce themselves as being Aes Sedai of the Green Ajah, \"Moiraine had seemed resigned to that more than anything else\". The older of the two women introduces herself as Coine, Sailmistress of Wavedancer, and the other woman as her sister, Jorin, Windfinder of Wavedancer. It is a surprise to Elayne that they are sisters because though she \"could see the resemblance (...) Jorin looked much younger\". Nynaeve asks to talk of their sailing and the gift of passage; \"The Sea Fold did not charge for passage (...) it was a gift, which just coincidentally would be exchanged for a gift of equal value\". Coine leads them below deck so that they can talk.\nAs they enter the cabin, Elayne notices a helmet and without thinking gasps out, \"Seanchan\", as it is the helmet of a Seanchan soldier. Coine tells them that they met a Seanchan ship and the soldiers tried to board Wavedancer; \"I have the helmet to remind me\". Nynaeve warns them about the damane the Seanchan keep on their ships. A female member of the crew brings them tea and to their surprise, \"she was bare to the waist, just like the men above\". Coine orders the girl, Dorele, to work in the bilges \"where clothes are a hindrance\". She apologizes to Elayne and Nynaeve who quickly assure her that they aren't offended, \"there are different ways among different people\".\nTalk turns to sailing and Nynaeve offers Coine three thousand gold marks to take them to Tanchico. Coine points out that it is a large amount of money \"even counting that you ask me to alter my sailing plans\". She adds that Aes Sedai are usually refused the gift of passage and that \"Aes Sedai know this, and so almost never ask\". Nynaeve demands to know why they were brought down below if they are to be refused. Coine explains that she has heard that Rand holds Callandor and the Aiel support him, \"Prophecy is being fulfilled\". She talks of the Jendai Prophecy and the Coramoor, obviously Rand. She explains that the Sea Folk welcome the prophecy, \"The one we seek, herald of a new Age\", and that they will serve the Coramoor. It is said that \"The White Tower will be broken by his name, and Aes Sedai shall kneel to wash his feet\".\nShe asks them why they want to go to Tanchico, \"It is an unpleasant port of call now\". Much to Nynaeve's reluctance, Elayne explains about the Black Ajah; \"We must find them, else they may harm (...) the Coramoor\". Surprisingly, it is Jorin, the Windfinder, who insists that they are given passage; \"We can take them, my sister. We must\". Before they can discuss anything else, a man, Coine's husband, comes into the cabin, talking of trade. Much to his surprise, Coine informs him that they will be leaving before he can receive any of his trade. He reveals himself to be Cargomaster upon the Wavedancer but he is overruled by Coine about when they are to leave. He is angered further when he discovers that they won't be sailing to Shara; \"What I have in my holds will bring little in Tanchico\". Coine doesn't give him an explanation as to why the plans have changed and he leaves them.\nNynaeve asks why Coine didn't explain that they were going to Tanchico for the three thousand gold crowns. Coine explains that \"many among the crew consider Aes Sedai bad luck\" and that if they knew of the Black Ajah, their passage would be troubled. Both Elayne and Nynaeve agree to hide their rings and the fact that they are Aes Sedai for the voyage. Coine then tells them that she will not accept the money and that \"I will put in the gift of passage from my own chest\", despite Jorin's argument that it will anger Toram further. Before they can talk further, the ship suddenly rolls as if they are in fierce water, not the Tairen docks. Jorin and Coine leave to check on the ship.\n",

                    "Summary": "Elayne and Nynaeve go up onto the deck to see if the ship is all right, which it is. Elayne believes that her letter caused Rand to overreact and channel, \"Men always overreact when they let their emotions go\". They then notice that Thom and Juilin are trying to board the ship and Coine tells them that they want passage. Under normal circumstances, she couldn't refuse them but \"I will do so, if you ask it\". Coine knows Juilin as \"twice he has found those who pilfered from us\". Nynaeve and Elayne decide to talk to the two men before making up their minds on whether or not to ask Coine to refuse passage.\nAs they approach the two men, Elayne thinks that she recognises Thom, \"She had been struck by something familiar about him\", though she cannot remember why. She then asks Juilin why he wants to travel to Tanchico and reminds him that \"You had not served us very well\". He points out that the last time he saw them he helped them escape from their cell in the Stone; Nynaeve is not happy about being reminded \"that they had needed help that time\". He then tells them that he was woken by Lan who asked him to accompany them to Tanchico. Apparently, Rand also gave a message for Juilin telling him to do that and \"I was given a great quantity of gold\". Both men were emphatic that if they did not return in one piece, \"Shall we just say it would be better to drown myself than come back\".\nThom then explains that \"a lady of our mutual acquaintance\", Moiraine, asked him to accompany them. He has been to Tanchico before and can \"help you with a good many things\". Elayne is once again struck with the familiarity of Thom and pulls one of his moustaches, \"I seemed to remember doing that before\". Nynaeve then agrees that they should be allowed passage and makes the two men swear that they will do as they are told. Both agree reluctantly and go to see Coine. Nynaeve explains that they must be firm with Thom and Juilin because at least Thom knows that they are Accepted, not full Aes Sedai, and they will soon know that they will search for the Black Ajah. She doesn't trust either man because \"Juilin Sandar betrayed us once before\" and for Thom, \"He admits being sent by Moiraine\".\nA Tairen pilot is ushered aboard and they set sail out through the Fingers of the Dragon. As they see the Sea of Storms, the pilot leaves the ship and they sail out into the sea. When they can no longer see land, all the women take their blouses off, as is customary for the Sea Folk. Elayne talks to Thom when she sees that he is alone up on deck; \"Are you not happy, Master Merrilin?\" Thom's answer explains that he feels trapped, probably talking about how Moiraine convinced him into going to Tanchico, though Elayne doesn't know this. He talks of how the events leading up to Tarmon Gai'don will not be known in the next age, that the characters will all be changed; \"two dozen generations and you may be the hero of it\". He then talks about legends from the age before the Age of Legends, which seem familiar to our age. \"Mosk and Merk\" describe Russia and America in the Cold War while Elsbet is Queen Elizabeth I of England. This makes most people believe that we are living in the age before the Age of Legends.\nThom goes on to talk about Shara, the land beyond the Aiel Waste. He explains that the Sea Folk only see \"a few miles around the handful or harbours where they are permitted to land\". Landing anywhere apart from these harbours is forbidden and it was the same for the Cairhienin traders who travelled the Silk Path. Elayne points out that he could learn more from the Sea Folk about Shara, something that puzzles Thom; \"I have never heard any such name\". When Elayne asks him why he agreed to accompany them, he explains that \"Aes Sedai asking favours are not easily resisted\". Elayne then leaves Thom and walks towards the stern of the ship.\nThere, she sees Jorin channeling weaves of Air and Water, changing the weather so it is favourable for the ship. When Elayne approaches her, Jorin explains \"I meant not to do this at all, but Coine says we must go quickly\". Elayne realises that that was why \"the Sea Folk do not carry Aes Sedai\" and \"That is why it was your decision to let us aboard\". Jorin explains that it is kept secret because \"Your White Tower will try to interfere\" and Elayne cannot deny that. Not all the Windfinders can channel and some channelers are sent to the White Tower to avoid suspicion. Elayne promises to try to keep the matter secret.\nShe then asks if there was a damane on the Seanchan ship they had encountered. Jorin says that there was and that \"I regret it because we might have saved the woman, the damane\". Elayne asks Jorin to teach her how to change the weather because of the complexity and size of the weaves, \"I am astounded, Jorin\". She also learns that they will reach Tanchico in ten days, something she had thought impossible.\n",

Moiraine wonders where Lan went to, as she can not see him in the crowd, even though she senses he is near. They have no clue about what Rand is planning on telling these nobles who stand around in nervous crowds. Moiraine suggests that Egwene wins Rand's confidence and she is not too happy about Egwene's persistence about going to the Waste but she thinks to herself it might be better in the end. At least Elayne and Nynaeve are safely on their way to Tanchico on the Windfinders ship. Moiraine ponders if her suspicions about the Windfinders will prove to be correct.\nThom Merrilin also seems to have disappeared from the Tower but Moiraine suspects he went with the two girls. Moiraine also received the most amazing letter from the Aiel Wise Ones. Moiraine regrets him leaving as he was very useful in keeping the nobles and their intrigues out of Rand's way. She notices the High lady Alteima and Estanda giving each other looks that go beyond mere rivalry.\nMat is standing across from them, his clothes looking like he slept in them and his boots all scuffed. They wonder where Perrin is, as he does not seem to be among the crowd gathered.\nTo Egwene's surprise Moiraine mentions Faile has been trying to talk him into leaving. Rand appears at this moment with a hundred veiled Aiel in his wake. Rand tells the gathering about the treaty with Mayene and orders the Tairen army to march to Cairhien, not to go to war with them but to try and help them restore law and order. Then, in a historical moment he drives his sword Callandor into the Heart of the Stone, challenging anyone to take the sword if they dare while he is gone. Rand storms out, followed closely by Moiraine and Egwene demanding an explanation for why he would give up on a great power like Callandor. Rand says he was merely fulfilling the prophecies and tells them about the trap he has set with the One Power should anyone try to take it.\nAfter that he tells them he means to go to Rhuidean.\n"

Rand and Egwene briefly discuss if Rand should have let them take the \"fifth\". Rand mentions that he saw Aviendha showing Rhuarc a silver bowl, and Egwene turns around to say that it IS their custom after all. It is a strange procession with the Aiel, Lan and Moiraine and Rand on his new horse Jeade'en, \"True Finder\" in the old tongue. Egwene starts talking to Rand about Elayne but Moiraine cuts in, demanding to know Rand's plan. He tells them he means to take them to Rhuidean by means of a Portal Stone only one hour's ride away from Tear. The plan is not met with approval, everybody thinks he is mad to try and use the Portal Stone and will probably kill them all in the process. Rand offers Mat the chance to leave right there and then, but Mat refuses saying he wants to see Rhuidean. They ride on till they reach the spot where the Portal Stone should be located although all Rand has to go on are some old maps he found in the library of the Stone. He tells them about the manuscript he found from a peddler who ventured into the Waste and claimed to see a golden city floating above the clouds, but more to the point how he describes a Portal Stone near Rhuidean in details. So this is how Rand is sure there is a Portal Stone out there as well. The old maps are different from the landscape now and Rand is not sure exactly where to find the stone. Lan suggests he sends out the Aiel to find the stone. Rhuarc picks members\u200b from every clan until a good quarter of them are fanning out over the surrounding hills to find the Stone. Rand watches them go and muses about the Jenn Aiel, about Aiel and their blood feuds, and wonders out loud what it is that holds them together now, here.\nRhuarc says they follow the prophecy and seek He Who Comes With The Dawn and how none may shed blood on the grounds of Rhuidean.\n"

The men all visibly relax, it seems they were not so sure the peace would hold. Aviendha promptly starts to move to the camps, but is stopped by the Wise Ones, saying she has run long enough. Rhuarc goes to greet his wife Amys and tells her she probably didn't expect him to turn up like that, to which she replies she knew he would be there that day. Egwene finally understands Moiraine's remarks about how useful Dreaming would be and why Moiraine did not try and talk Rand out of using the Portal Stone. Heirn is there to meet Rhuarc, saying that he has come to protect the Wise Ones.\nLan whispers to Moirane and Egwene that the Wise Ones can go anywhere without being in danger from attack, so Heirn really came to protect Rhuarc, only it would not be honorable to say so. Moiraine raises an eyebrow at Lan's knowledge of the Aiel and he remarks she never asked him about it, something she plans on correcting very soon.\nThe Shaido are there and have sent Muradin to Rhuidean to become their new clan chief. Couladin remarks he will enter should Muradin fail, but the Wise One's flat out refuse him, saying he is flawed inside. Rand formally requests to be admitted to Rhuidean and although the Wise Ones are mildly surprised they agree. To everyone's surprise Mat also asks to be permitted to enter Rhuidean.

Mat tells Rand he has to enter, even though the thought is not very tempting.

The fog seems to go on forever but they finally step out into a hollow dome. Rhuidean is not as big as Tear or Caemlyn, but the streets are very wide, if deserted, with great fountains and statues. The city appears unfinished for all its splendor. No water fills any of the fountains. The fountains make Rand think though and suddenly realises when looking at the city that it must have had access to water at some point.\nRand channels water up through the ground from an underground lake that he can detect with the Power.

Perrin won't even let himself acknowledge that it's Faile's group he and Gaul are following. As they continue he observes that the Ways do not seem to bother the Aiel man but Perrin is alert and listening for the slightest sound of Machin Shin, knowing that his ears will be the first to pick up any sound. Perrin notices that Faile and Loial's party in front have stopped so he draws rein in the middle of the bridge he was crossing. He notices that the bridge looks like it is about to crumble underneath him. The horses are nervous and Perrin sympathizes with them and thinks that it would be more comforting if there were more people around. But regardless of his feelings he will not go closer to the small group of people ahead of him. Not after what had happened on the island just after they had left Tear.\nHe remembers the event...\nPerrin had led his horse Stepper over to the Guiding and he walked around the island studying the bridges leading from it. Gaul had seemed to not be at all bothered by being in the Ways. When Loial had arrived on the island with Faile she had immediately hopped from her horse and strode over to Perrin with a very fixed expression and he began to speak to her but she slapped him across the face and told him off for going on and rushing off like a wild boar. He says that he had asked her not to do that and she hits him again. Faile had been furious with Perrin for going off ahead and with Loial for trying to intervene and also furious with Bain and Chiad for not intervening. Bain had replied that she did not think that Faile would have wanted them to seeing as she had picked the fight herself. Faile then had seemed to lose her anger toward Perrin, which had made him nervous. She had stared at him then with unshed tears in her eyes.\nGaul brings Perrin back to the present by telling him that the party in front were moving again. And they carry along their way down the next ramp. Perrin muses to himself that he hates the ramps, sided by darkness and seeming to curve in circles with no visible means of support. Gaul is looking slightly confused at the next island as it seems that they are directly below the one they had just left and Perrin is glad that he is not the only one to notice. Once more Faile and Loial stop by the Guiding but they do not move on. Faile calls to Perrin asking him to come over. He goes over and asks what she wants and she tells him that she just wanted to see if he would come when she called. She smiles at him, Perrin thinks probably because she heard his teeth grinding. Perrin scrubs at his nose as he has noticed a faint rank smell. Gaul chuckles and comments on the way of women and how it is easier to understand the sun as a woman. Bain whispers to Chiad and they both laugh and from the way the two women look at him and Gaul, Perrin thinks he would rather not know what they were laughing at.\nLoial says that was not the reason at all and that the real reason is because they have arrived. He points to the Guiding and tells them it is the Waygate to Manetheren. Perrin nods, not wanting to suggest anything for fear of Faile's reaction. He rubs his nose again because of the smell of rankness. Then suddenly his ears pick up the distant sound of hooves and the smell hits home to him. He shouts that there are Trollocs. Gaul reacts and immediately kills one of the approaching monsters. A fight begins with all of them defending themselves against the Trollocs, until they have defeated them all. Perrin looks around and assesses everyone's injuries - he is glad to see that Faile is unhurt. He believes the only reason they managed to fend them all off is due to the Trollocs' eyesight not adjusting quickly enough coming from the darkness into the light of the lanterns. They have only moments respite before a Fade leaps into the light. The Aiel fight the Fade, Gaul with his spear and Bain and Chiad shooting at it with their arrows. Suddenly one of Faile's knives blossoms in the Fade's face but the Fade does not give in. Perrin manages to swing at it with his hammer and it goes down. They leave the Fade thrashing wildly on the floor.\n",

                    "Summary": "Perrin and the others camp on the mountain outside the Waygate. Faile insists on there being two camps but Loial refuses and says that all of that is done with now. Faile remains stubborn and Perrin tells Loial that he will camp further away and motions him back to the women. Gaul joins Perrin and they look over to the other camp. The women are laughing together and Loial seems to be trying to hide in his book whilst keeping some distance from them. Perrin thinks that Faile believes they are far enough away for the Ogier not to hear and that they probably haven't realised that they are embarrassing him with their chatter. Gaul says to Perrin that this place looks more like the three-fold land than any other in the Wetlands and that it does not seem as strange to him as what they call forests. Perrin wishes to see Gaul's land and Gaul thinks that maybe some day he might. Gaul asks Perrin if this is where Manetheren stood and whether he is one of its blood, to which Perrin replies yes it/he is but that they are no longer a nation of great warriors. Gaul smiles and comments that he has seen Perrin and the other Two Rivers boys fight and that he disagrees. Perrin is surprised that Gaul knows about Manetheren but Gaul says that he read many books before crossing the Dragonwall although many things he had underestimated. Gaul then asks Perrin if he thinks it was chance that there were Trollocs heading for this Waygate and Perrin says no and that he had also seen ravens. Perrin feels out for the wolves again but finds nothing. He tells Gaul that he may find out something tonight but that he may need kicking awake if necessary. Perrin realises that this is a very strange thing to say but Gaul just accepts it like he accepts that the colour of Perrin's eyes are different, without comment.\nPerrin goes to sleep and seeks the Wolf Dream. He finds himself near the Waygate in daylight but wearing the hammer on his belt instead of his axe. He frowns at it and the axe momentarily flickers back into place but does not last long and the hammer reappears. He doesn't remember that ever happening before but thinks that the wolf dream is full of oddities. As though the thought triggered it a dark patch of sky appeared, a window to somewhere else. Rand stood amid swirling storm winds laughing madly, arms upraised, hidden eyes watched him and Perrin could not tell if Rand knew or not. The window winked out and another appears, further over this time, showing Nynaeve and Elayne stalking through a landscape of twisted shadowed buildings hunting some dangerous beast. Perrin didn't know how he knew it was dangerous but he was certain of it. That window also winks out and another appears. Mat is standing at a fork in a road, he flips a coin and starts down one branch and suddenly he is wearing a wide brimmed hat and walking with a staff bearing a short sword blade. Another window appears and he sees Egwene and a woman with long white hair, they both stare at him in surprise while behind them the White Tower crumbles stone by stone, then they are gone too.\nPerrin had seen these windows before and thought that they were real in some way or that they meant something. The wolves never saw them. Moiraine had suggested that the wolf dream was like Tel'aran'rhiod and then would say no more. Perrin calls out for Hopper but he does not come, so he carries on to see what he can find out. He \"steps\" into the spot where he had seen the ravens earlier and then makes his way east towards the Two Rivers looking for wolves. He calls for Hopper again but he does not come. Perrin is troubled because he can't even sense any wolves, but there are always other wolves somewhere in the wolf dream. Perrin suddenly sees another man standing on top of a hill, he is too far away to see clearly but he is tall with dark hair and is wearing a blue coat with a bow on his back, but Perrin feels there is something familiar about him. He catches the man's scent and he smells cold and something not really human. The man looks up and sees Perrin then disappears in a streak across the hills. Perrin leaps down to where the man had been and finds a half-skinned corpse of a wolf. Perrin is shocked that a wolf has been killed here in the wolf dream, something very evil must be responsible. Perrin chases the man until he sees a metal tower sparkling in the sun. The man heads straight for it and Perrin follows. Perrin can find no way into the tower but it also smells of that cold inhuman scent.\nPerrin feels a raw emotion and his brain identifies it in one word - stop! It is Hopper. He tells Perrin that he is chasing the Slayer, who is here in flesh and can kill and also that there are other things of the shadow walking the dream and it is no longer safe. Hopper tells him he cannot chase Slayer into the tower and kill him because Slayer kills. Perrin senses a finality about the way \"kills\" is said and asks Hopper what happens if a wolf dies in the dream. Hopper tells him that wolves that die in the dream die forever. Perrin hears a voice behind him and spins around. A woman is there and she tells him that the Tower of Ghenjei is a bad place for humankind. The woman has her golden hair braided and is wearing wide yellow trousers and boots and carrying a silver bow which she hides under her cloak when she sees Perrin notice it. He asks if she is Aes Sedai, and she says that no, she only came to warn him, despite the prescripts. Once entered the Tower of Ghenjei is hard enough to leave in the world of men but here it is almost impossible. He asks what the Tower of Ghenjei is and that Hopper had told him of it. She is surprised that he can talk to wolves. She tells him that it is a doorway to the realms of the Aelfinn and the Eelfinn as though he should know who they are. Perrin looks at her blankly so she asks him has he ever played the game Snakes & Foxes. He says that he did as a child until he figured out there was no way to win. She says the only way is to break the rules and then she recites from the game \"courage to strengthen, fire to blind, music to daze, iron to bind\" Perrin says he does not understand what this has to do with the tower. She says that the game is a remembrance of old dealings and that it does not matter as long as he stays away from the Aelfinn and the Eelfinn. The woman also says that they are not evil in the way that the Shadow is evil but that they are so different from humankind that they might as well be and they are not to be trusted. That he should stay away from the Tower of Ghenjei and to avoid the World of Dreams if he can because dark things walk there. Perrin asks if she means Slayer. She says that Slayer is a good name for him, that he is not old but that his evil is ancient. Then she stops and says she doesn't understand why she's telling him all this. Then she seems to think for a second and then asks him if he is ta'veren. Perrin does not answer but asks who she is and that he feels he has met her somewhere before. The woman replies that she has broken too many of the prescripts already. He asks her what prescripts but is distracted by a shadow behind him - a man with two sword hilts rising above his shoulders - and something about him is familiar too. The woman says that the man is right and she should not be talking to Perrin and she disappears. Perrin frowns at Hopper and asks what he thinks of her. Hopper is confused as he had not seen her, only Perrin talking to the air. Perrin tells Hopper that he has come away from what he intended and explains his need to find wolves in the Two Rivers. Hopper remains silent for a while and then tells Perrin that he should not go home, there are no wolves there now and those who did not flee are dead. Slayer walks the dream there. Perrin says he has to go home and Hopper tells him to take care and that the day of the Last Hunt draws near and that they will run together in the Last Hunt.\nPerrin opens his eyes. Gaul is on watch over him and Faile is awake at the other camp taking her turn at guard. He tells Gaul that he will take guard for a while and that things may be worse in the Two Rivers than he'd thought. Gaul replies that things often are and that it is the way of life.\n",

Perrin is glad that he saw no more ravens. Several times he thought that Faile was going to bring her horse closer to talk to him but she restrained herself each time. Loial is still riding with her at Perrin's request. Perrin is worrying about whether Slayer walks the Two Rivers in the waking world as well as in the Wolf Dream, but suspects that he did both. Perrin thinks about his family and worries that if the Whitecloaks are looking for Aybaras then they would be easy to find.\nHe could have headed straight for Emond's Field but he goes northward to the Quarry Road instead. Perrin smelled the farm before he sees it, a smell of char, not new, but still strong. He reins in and sits staring before he can make himself ride into what had been the al'Thor farm. Only the stone-walled sheep pen still stands and the tumbled burnt beams of the farmhouse. He realizes that the fire was weeks old and everything is covered in vines. The Aiel search the ruins carefully and Bain returns from the ruins and indicates that there is no sign of anyone inside. Perrin is glad that Tam had not died there and it is all that he could do to stop himself setting Stepper to a gallop and riding all the way to his own family's farm but he knows that the horse would never make it all that way. Gaul reports that whoever did this was long gone but that he thinks two men came back and drove the remaining sheep away north. Faile rides over to him and asks if he knew who lived there. He tells her it was Rand and his father. She is relieved and sympathetic, then asks if his family live nearby. He curtly says no and turns his back on her to speak to Gaul. He says they will have to camp close and that he wants an early start in the morning and that the people in Emond's Field will know what's going on. Gaul hesitates and says to Perrin that he will not be able to drive Faile off, that she is almost Far Dareis Mai and that if a Maiden loves you, you cannot escape her. Perrin quietly tells Gaul that they will leave early, while Faile is still asleep.\n",

Rand already took what he needed. Aiel have been moving in the city, occupying many of the buildings and starting to cultivate crops with water from the new formed lake. Rand can see the burnt remains of the Tree of Life. Moiraine says the tree still lives and will produce shoots again.\nRand turns his attention back to the six Aiel clan chiefs in the room. Only six of the twelve Aiel clans represented. Rand wants to know what he has to do to get the others to join him. The clan chiefs agree that there is not much to do but to wait. The revelation of Aiel descending from pacifists has shocked the clans to the core. They need time to deal with it. Even now Aiel are throwing down their weapons and simply walking away from their way of life. The bleakness as it is called has taken many Aiel already. The Shaido are unlikely to join Rand though. Couladin leads them now, even though he is not a clan chief. He has been telling people he is the Dragon Reborn and that Rand lied to them. There isn't much news from the other side of the Dragonwall either. Rand sees Moiraine and Egwene waiting for him to conclude the meeting. There is nothing more to discuss so Rand tells the clan chiefs to keep an eye on the Shaido and bring in the other clans.\nJasin Natael is still playing his harp in the background as Egwene and Moiraine approach. Moiraine tells him the wagons with Power-related objects will be loaded soon. Rand says she'd better send a strong guard with them or Kadere won't deliver them to Tar Valon. Rand wants to know what Moiraine came to do. His rude demand is punished by one of the women by a weave of Air striking him. Rand can't tell which of them did it but he won't be provoked. Moiraine wants him to send Jasin Natael away but Rand refuses. Jasin can hear whatever Moiraine has to say. Egwene thinks Rand's head is getting big indeed.\n"

He doesn't stop to talk to any of the Maidens but he does answer them with a smile. Rand had chosen this building to stay in because it was finished and kept the day's heat and the night's cold out for the most part. One day he found the Maidens had just moved in with him and expected him to stay. At least he managed to convince them to keep the floor he was using for himself.\nRand goes to the room he has for himself. He is upset that he let Moiraine know about his plans. She has a way of getting him angry enough to give away stuff he didn't want anybody to know yet. In a way he can trust Asmodean more than he can trust her. Asmodean needs him, Moiraine sees him as means to an end.\nAviendha walks into the room with a pile of blankets. Rand asks where she has been the past ten days. He'd expected her to watch him more closely after he locked the Wise Ones out of his dreams. A useful trick Asmodean taught him. She tells him she had training to do. The Wise Ones were not pleased with what Rand did and even less pleased with Aviendha letting him know.

The Aiel see it differently and will go if Rand leads them out of the waste. The discussion goes back and forth a bit but their positions don't change. Bair dismisses Moiraine politely.\nWhen Moiraine is gone the Wise Ones tell Aviendha to pour tea. She flushes and says she hasn't made any yet. She hurries out of the tent to do so. Egwene notices she has been beaten recently. She asks Bair about it and she says Aviendha asked her to because she lied twice today. Egwene thinks all Aiel must be crazy.

Quickly he gets up grabs saidin and moves to another part of the building where he can fight it without any other people getting hurt. Then he waits for the enemy to approach. Three pony-sized dogs appear. Rand thinks a sword should be enough to kill them. He dances the forms among them and soon the dogs are dead. He underestimated them though, the dogs turn into a kind of liquid shadow and the pools of liquid draw together again. Soon the dogs are before him once more. Remembering a weave that might work a bar of liquid light hits the dogs and they disappear. He uses too much of the Power though and a part of the wall disappears too.\nMoiraine has entered the room and wants to know if any of the dogs bled on him or bit him. Rand wants to know why the Maidens let her in. They grant Moiraine some Wise One privileges it seems. The dogs were Darkhounds, their blood and saliva are poison. She may not have been able to Heal those wounds. She tells him they must speak of what he used to kill the Darkhounds. She also says packs are usually larger. Rand cuts her off at that and runs out to see if there are more Darkhounds around. Lan sees him storming past and wants to know where Moiraine is but Rand doesn't reply.\nHe sees three more Darkhounds trying to claw their way into a building Mat is sleeping in. He uses the same weave and manages to control it better this time. The door is heavily damaged but Mat only has a minor injury on his arm. Moiraine and Lan arrive at the scene and Moiraine tries to Heal Mat's Darkhound wound. The foxhead medallion blocks her weaves though. Reluctantly Mat takes it off. When Mat is Healed Rand breaks up the crowd. Moiraine wants to talk to him alone.\nRand wants to wait till tomorrow and he makes it quite clear he will not help her get that medallion. Mat paid a high price for it and it is his. Moiraine now resorts to pleading to get Rand to listen. Lan doesn't like this one bit and his opinion of Rand drops even further when Moiraine takes an oath to obey him and apologizes for any offence she may have given. This gets Rand's attention. He accepts her help and apology and apologizes for acting rude towards her.\nMoiraine now explains the dangers of balefire, the weave Rand used to destroy the Darkhounds. Balefire pulls a thread from the Pattern. Whatever the creature did till a certain point before it was balefired ceases to exist. In the War of the Shadow whole cities were destroyed using this weapon until both sides realized the Pattern might unravel. The weave is forbidden by the Tower. Rand has seen Moiraine use it once though. Rand can't promise not to use it again.\nRand now opens a gateway, something Moiraine didn't know he could do, to check on someone and tells her he'll see her in the morning. Darkhounds had been near Asmodean's quarters. Did his traps destroy them or did they go back to report? Rand removes the tracks and goes to check on the powerful ter'angreal he hid elsewhere. They too are where he left them.\nLanfear shows up and sees him with the ter'angreal, she thinks he is considering her plan. Lews Therin speaks up and tells Lanfear she is only ambition. Once he saw that, he didn't love her anymore. Lanfear says Asmodean has been telling lies about her. Rand wants to know why she is here. She tells him Rahvin sent the Darkhounds tonight. He is in Caemlyn using Morgase as a puppet to control Andor and gain the Sun Throne. With Rand's Tairen soldiers moving into Cairhien and Rahvin's Andoran soldiers crossing the border as well, something has to be done soon.\n"

Nynaeve points out that he has Aviendha watching over him and that everything will be quite all right. Elayne also seems to know more about Thom's past. He must have been more than a gleeman once. But whatever it is she is not telling Nynaeve.\nThe town looks very dispirited to Nynaeve. They look around for fresh vegetables but nobody is selling anything worth that name. Nynaeve wonders how these people are going to make it through the winter. Then Nynaeve sees a sign above a seamstress' shop. A bundle of herbs signaling one of the Yellow Ajah's eyes-and-ears is active there. The sign is only used for the most pressing messages. Nynaeve wants to find out what the message is.\n",

Elayne can't channel or move and will remain that way for a while longer. These women had to be Darkfriends. Elayne tries to find saidar but it is pointless. Macura leaves to send messages and make arrangements to send them off. She leaves instructions to give Elayne and Nynaeve another dose in an hour. Just as Elayne is regaining some of her motor skills Luci gives her another dose and she loses consciousness again. When she wakes up her ability to move comes back slowly again. Then the door crashes open and Thom is in the doorway demanding to know what Luci gave them.\nNynaeve tells him it was Macura. Ronde Macura is brought in a bit later by Juilin. He found her when she was trying to get into the house the back way. It is time for interrogation now. Nynaeve makes it clear to Macura that Juilin knows ways to make people talk. Juilin plays his part well and starts talking about ropes and things he may will need to interrogate them. Ronde Macura decides to talk. She gave them the real message. The reason she drugged them though was because of a description of Elayne was passed with instructions to send her back to the White Tower. Why would Siuan Sanche want her back in Tar Valon after she send them away herself?\nThe only name they can wring out of the woman is Narenwin Barda. A Yellow Elayne has seen but doesn't know very well. She hardly seems the type to be Black Ajah. Macura swears she serves the Yellows, not the Black Ajah. Convinced there is nothing more to learn they tie the two of them up and go downstairs.\nElayne asks Juilin what he intended to do with the things he said he needed to make them talk. Juilin says he has no idea. He just let their imagination do the work. He tells them he made a man crack once by sending for figs and mice. Elayne doesn't want to think about what those would be used for.\nNynaeve surprises Elayne by thanking Thom and Juilin. It must be like pulling a tooth for Nynaeve to admit she needed someone's help. Nynaeve looks through the herbs Ronde Macura keeps and finds something that will dye Elayne's hair black. Nynaeve also takes the tea, forkroot Macura called it, that prevents a woman from channeling. They decide to give up their disguise as merchants and purchase the coach they spotted in the village earlier to travel as a lady with her retainers.\n"

They spot \"giant boar-horses\" that Luca claims came from Shara, but both Elayne and Nynaeve know that they are Seanchan creatures, having seen them in Falme.\nHe says for a \"pittance\" he will have his show perform for them before he leaves for Ghealdan. Elayne declines and he admits that his boar-horses caused trouble in a nearby town, and the people of Sienda will not allow him to perform.\nElayne tells Nynaeve to give him some money and they continue on to Sienda. Elayne asks her how much she gave to Luca. Nynaeve had given him only a silver penny, which Elayne is not happy with, but decides to keep quiet rather than cause another fight.\nThey reach Sienda in the late afternoon, and could see where the boar-horse had caused trouble: at the inn called The King's Lancer. They note that there are many Whitecloaks and almost as many King's men wandering around the town, and they did not seem to get along.\n"

Nynaeve is worried about Birgitte being seen, but Birgitte shrugs it off and says that each Forsaken has been \"stalking the others unseen.\" Nynaeve thinks they are plotting, but Birgitte does not know what they are up to, but that \"their work has never boded well for the world, waking or dreaming.\" Nynaeve wants her to continue trying to find out what they are up to, but not to take any risks.\nShe then asks Birgitte if she has seen Moghedien, but Birgitte has not.

He tells the Forsaken he is too tired for a \"discussion\" today. Rand tells him to go to his tent and expects to see him in the morning. Asmodean asks if Rand suddenly trusts him when he fails to ward Asmodean's tent. Rand says he trusts the man until he betrays him and that Rand will bury him the moment he does.

It is pointed out to them that while they may have been Amyrlin and Keeper they are Aes Sedai no longer.

They can reroute the reports sent by the eyes and ears of their networks to Salidar. That would be a great advantage. They also have Logain who will testify that the Red Ajah set him up as false Dragon. Doing so Leane and Siuan reveal a lot about those networks that wasn't known to the Aes Sedai. With this new information returning to the Tower has become impossible. Siuan is outraged they would even consider that but the Tower must be strong at this time. That opportunity has passed though. Reluctantly they agree to use Siuan and Leane's contacts.\nAccording to the strategy Siuan and Leane worked out earlier Leane now puts another idea in the heads of the six Aes Sedai. Forming a Hall of Sitters and raising their own Amyrlin. This would mean the Tower would be broken for the world to see and that they have no other choice than to strive for Elaida's removal. The idea seems to take hold. Siuan also discusses the whereabouts of Rand with them. She thinks he is in the Aiel Waste and that a sister should be send to him before one of Elaida's can reach him.

As she and Elayne ready themselves for the day, Elayne tells her about what had happened in Tel'aran'rhiod after Nynaeve and Leane had left. Nynaeve begins to grumble about how the Aes Sedai think they know everything, and then mentions to Elayne that she thinks she saw Rand in Tel'aran'rhiod, and Elayne bemoans the fact that she isn't with him.\nAfter they finish dressing and Elayne leaves, Nynaeve wanders off to find Moghedien. She finds the Forsaken washing clothes with some other women. The woman in charge tells Nynaeve that Myrelle had told her that \"Marigan\" could help with the washing, so Nynaeve takes off. As she walks, she sees Myrelle, but luckily for Nynaeve, the Aes Sedai does not notice her.\nEventually, she finds Logain, who is surrounded by people. He is telling them his story of how the Red Ajah set him up as a false Dragon. Lelaine and her Warder, Burin Shaeren, are keeping watch over him. When he finishes his tale, Lelaine assures them that Logain no longer wants glory, and that their lands are in no danger from him. When Lelaine notices Nynaeve, Nynaeve hastily curtsies and then hurries off.\nNext, Nynaeve comes upon Siuan, who is facing off Gareth Bryne. They are fighting over the fact that he tried to pay her a compliment, and how she had nearly snapped his head off for it. After Gareth leaves, Nynaeve informs Siuan that she means to study her stilling, since Nynaeve has only had two chances so far to study her.\nLeane shows up. \"I tried to talk them out of it. Only they had not listened to you enough to even consider it. You won't be meeting the Wise Ones tonight.\" When Leane and Siuan stalk off, Lelaine, who was standing behind them, remarks that Siuan and Leane should be sent off to Tiana, the Mistress of Novices, for always seeming to fight with each other. Lelaine then asks Nynaeve what she thinks Rand will do. Nynaeve tells Lelaine that she has not seen Rand in half a year, and that she knows nothing of what he is doing. Lelaine goes on to mention Egwene, Mat and Perrin. Lelaine then tries to talk Nynaeve out of trying to Heal Siuan and Leane, but she refuses.\nWhen Nynaeve leaves, she passes by Uno, who is training heavy cavalry for the Salidar army. He smiles at her, and she moves on. She eventually runs into Elayne's novice class. As she watches, Theodrin approaches her. They speak of Nynaeve's block, and Theodrin informs Nynaeve that they will work on breaking Nynaeve's block the next day.\n"

Thoughts of all the administrative duties that must be taken care of in Andor are running through his mind as he, Bashere and Bael talk. They speak of, among other things, the people that are arriving in Caemlyn, the way that Rand twists chance, and Morgase. Bael also mentions that two Aes Sedai are staying in the New City. Rand decides that this may be something important, and says that he will go visit them.\nWhen Rand arrives at the inn, he finds a huge surprise awaiting him: there is a group of girls, perhaps a dozen, from the Two Rivers in the common room. Among them are Bodewhin Cauthon, Hilde Barran, Jerilin al'Caar, Marisa Ahan, Emry Lewin, Elise Marwin, Darea Candwin, Larine Ayellin, Jancy Torfinn, Susa al'Seen, and Marce Eldin. Bodewhin asks about Mat, and mentions that they have come with Verin and Alanna because all of them can learn to channel. All of the girls from the Emond's Field area crowd around him and begin talking, telling him of all that has happened since he left.\nEventually, Verin and Alanna appear. The two Aes Sedai and Rand leave to speak alone in the innkeeper, Master Dilham's, private dining room. The first thing that Rand asks is if they will be taking the Two Rivers girls to the rebels, or to Elaida. Rand wants to know more about the rebels, but Alanna and Verin will not tell him.\nAfter a little more talking, Alanna steps towards Rand. He steps back from her, but she tells him not to worry. \"Like you, Rand, I mean no harm. Nothing I do here will cause you any injury.\" He decides to trust her, since she had said it straight out. Verin and Alanna link, and Alanna bonds him as her Warder without asking. He demands to know what they did, and seizes saidin. Verin and Alanna try to shield him, but he ends up shielding them instead. They tell him what Alanna did, and he tells him that they are to stay away from him, and that the Inner City of Caemlyn is barred to them. He then storms out of the room.\n"

An envoy from the Tower is there and the entire building is guarded against eavesdropping. Elayne tells Moghedien that the flows she had shown them were not getting through the ward. Moghedien says that they \"should\" get through but it could take days to spin through the ward. Nynaeve bites her tongue because they have been trying for days. This is the third day since Tarna had arrived and there was still no word on what message she had brought.\nElayne tries to hand the a'dam bracelet to Nynaeve so she can go teach her novice classes and try to show Aes Sedai how to make ter'angreal again. Nynaeve refuses and tells Elayne to wear it instead of leaving it behind. She still doesn't trust Moghedien but hates wearing the thing herself. Besides, she has work to do for some Sitters and another lesson with Theodrin.\nNynaeve feels that everyone is just wasting time around Salidar and not really doing anything. Moghedien picks up on Nynaeve's thoughts and starts suggesting that her and Elayne run off to Caemlyn to be with Rand. Nynaeve wonders why Moghedien looks so calm. She realizes that the bracelet isn't in the room. She has never been alone with Moghedien without the bracelet. She gets nervous and reminds Moghedien that she would suffer death if they left and anyone found out who she was. Moghedien says that the a'dam will hold her just as well in Caemlyn and that they better hurry up before Salidar decided to reunite the Tower and turn them over to Elaida. Nynaeve tells her to clean up and leaves before she loses her stomach.\nUpon leaving, she searches out Birgitte. She asks her to get horses so they can leave, but not to tell anyone like Thom or Uno. Birgitte thinks that is a bad idea and says that if Elayne agrees and gives the order, she will get the horses. Nynaeve then tries to get Birgitte to listen at the door to find out what is happening. Birgitte soundly refuses and Nynaeve fights not to lose her temper.\nNicola shows up and reminds Nynaeve that she is due at the Sitters' house to do her copy work for them. At Delana and Janya's, she notices there are no supplies to do copying. Soon after they start asking her to tell them everything about Rand once again. She tries to give them new answers but can't think of anything new to tell them. They finally let her go and she hurries to her lesson with Theodrin.\n",

Rand dismisses Norry and Bashere presents four of the most powerful nobles in Andor. Lady Dyelin, Lord Abelle, Lady Ellorien and Lord Luan. Rand is following Moiraine's advice and behaves like a king. The four are obviously not at ease and they are trying to find out how much of what they heard about Rand is true. They are visibly relieved to see Bashere leave. He is a foreign Lord with an army in Andor. Maybe his influence isn't quite as big as they feared.\nAndorans are more straightforward then Cairhienin or Tairens so Rand keeps it simple. He won't tell them what to believe of the countless rumours about him that they must have heard. What he wants is to make sure Elayne gets the Lion Throne and then leave governing to her. Luan, Ellorien and Abelle seem to think Rand has a hidden agenda. They speak for Dyelin who after Elayne is next in line for the throne. Dyelin, however, speaks for Elayne. She says she will see what the Dragon Reborn does and will, if he does what he promises, support him in the Last Battle. If he doesn't, however, she will come against him and the other three declare they would support her. That is enough for Rand at the moment so he breaks up the meeting.\nBefore the nobles leave he takes Dyelin aside for a moment and asks why many of the Andoran nobles look at him strangely. Dyelin tells him he looks like Tigraine, the Daughter-Heir who disappeared some twenty-five years ago. Some blame Gitara Moroso for that disappearance and that of her brother Luc. Her story fits with what Rand knows about his mother from the Wise Ones.\n",

In his head Lews Therin hums appreciative of Berelain's gown.\nOn the way to the office Rhuarc and Berelain share they walk past a group of women practising the sword, inspired by the Maidens of the Spear. The Aiel are upset over this because these women claim to follow ji'e'toh. According to the Aiel they get it all wrong. Berelain promised not to send the women back to their families though. Rand thinks that this may be a way to heal the wounded pride of the Cairhienin and will allow it as long as they stop pretending to follow ji'e'toh.\nWhen they arrive at the office Rand asks how things are in Cairhien. Both answer things are as well as can be expected. Caraline Damodred and Toram Riatin are still gathering people for their rebellion but most Cairhienin seem tired of war. Rumour has it that some Andorans joined them though. The Shaido are still in the Kinslayer's Dagger, showing signs of settling on this side of the Dragonwall. There is also word of fighting in Shara, highly unusual for that part of the world. Sammael is highest on the list of priorities though, the rest can wait.\n",

Rand thinks back on the results of his previous visit as Haman leads them to the Waygate. Rand does not want to remove the keys, as the gate may one day be needed, so he puts a very nasty weave around it to kill Shadowspawn. It would kill them slowly, so the next Fade to come through would not be warned. As he channels, he feels the taint so strongly it pulsed, even releasing saidin afterwards doesn't help completely. He decides that it was the evil in Shadar Logoth resonating with the evil of the taint. As he prepares to Travel again, he realizes someone was missing. The Aiel discover it was Liah.

His musing is interrupted when Nalesean asks him if he ever wondered what it would be like to be a Warder. Mat replies that he avoids thinking about Aes Sedai, and advises them to do the same. The rumor of Dragonsworn is then brought up, which Mat declares is Rand's problem.\nMat's best scout, Chel Vanin, rides up and says that he has found something that Mat has to see. They ride a short ways off and come to what had been a Tinker caravan. There are dead everywhere. \"Whoever did this had not wanted any survivors.\" On the bottom of an overturned wagon, one man had written in his own blood, \"TELL THE DRAGON REBORN\" before he died. Mat tells Vanin to burn the wagon and tell no one about the message. Mat returns to the army and tells them to make camp, even though there are a few hours of daylight left.\nDisturbed by what he had seen, Mat is unable to sleep, and so takes his spear and blankets outside so he can count constellations. While doing this, he hears a soft noise and, looking around, sees several Aiel surround his tent, enter, then come out again. As he wondered if he could slip away, Talmanes approaches his tent, offering brandy. Seeing that he wasn't going to leave, Mat leaps up and shouts that there are Aiel in the camp. The Aiel attack him, but he manages to keep them off until his men start arriving, at which point he gets out of the way.\n",

Because of this, he sees a crossbowman on a roof, aiming at him. The bolt is stopped by a weave of Air; but Rand is knocked off his horse as someone crashes into him. He looks up from the ground to see one of the Maidens, Desora, on top of him, dying, a crossbow bolt through her ribs.\nOthers are dead, four prisoners in white cloaks with a Golden Sunburst on their chests are taken by the Aiel. Three are to be hanged, and one, Dimir Faral, is told to ride as fast as he can to Pedron Niall, with the message that someday, Rand will hang him.\nUpon returning to the Palace, Rand is told by the First Maid, Mistress Harfor, that a Wavemistress and Lady Elenia request an audience. Rand replies that he will see the Wavemistress in the mid-afternoon, and to send the Lady Elenia to his rooms.\n",

They also discuss what to do to at this point and decide to have Faolain and Theodrin ask questions about her maid's visitors in order to get information on the man that can channel who freed Moghedien.\nDuring Egwene's talk with Siuan and Leane she practices some of what Siuan taught her about being the Amyrlin Seat.\nAfter the talk Egwene decides to take a walk in order to tire herself so that she could sleep better, as she has been suffering from headaches. On her walk she passes by the area designated for Traveling and Skimming, just as a group of Aes Sedai and their Warders and servants come back from Salidar with information from their eyes-and-ears in the world. In the Skimming that Rand does, or that men do using saidin, one can encounter other men Skimming; but in the women's Skimming using saidar one cannot encounter another person skimming, unless they both start at precisely the same place and go to the same place.\nAs Egwene walks, she thinks on the rebel Aes Sedai having gained Talents that the White Tower thought lost forever, and discovered new ones. This should have made her feel better, but it didn't. She also thinks on a letter that arrived the day they left Salidar from the sisters that they sent to meet with Rand.  The letter was worded like the majority of letters that nobles use mainly for playing the Great Game of Houses. Basically the letter was saying that everything was going well and that Verin and Alanna had found some girls who could be trained to become Aes Sedai. Alanna had bonded Rand, but Egwene doesn't realize that that is what is meant by \"Alanna has formed an attachment to the wool merchant which may prove useful, though it is troubling too.\"  Egwene remembers that Sheriam thinks  Egwene would be delighted to see her friends from home, although she isn't.  She is more focused on how she is going to become known as the true Amyrlin Seat.\n",

Perrin acknowledges that\u2019s an option, but he does not want Abila to become a butcher\u2019s yard. Perrin\u2019s thoughts turn to Faile \u2014 he is getting used to her strange Saldaean ways. He thinks fondly of how she trims his beard for him.  \nMasuri and Seonid return to the horses. Masuri tells Perrin that Masema is rabid and must be killed. Perrin tells her that she could choose a better place to say something like that; he doesn\u2019t want to hear arguments right now. Edarra and Carelle return and the Wise Ones say that Masema\u2019s camp is no place for talking; they order Masuri and Seonid to their horses. Everyone mounts their horses and they ride out of Abila. \n",

Perrin gallops up and finds Berelain, Gallenne, Annoura and Gerard Arganda all standing there\u2014looking upset. Before Perrin can demand to know what happened, Berelain tells Perrin that she and Faile were hunting with Alliandre and they were attacked by Aiel. Berelain managed to escape but no one else has returned yet. She has sent a squad of lancers south to scout and they will return with news by nightfall.\nPerrin is shocked \u2014 Faile has been captured! He demands to know why they are still here, in the camp, and not out searching for her. Berelain responds that they do not know how many Aiel there are \u2014 if they pursue there may be a battle that costs them many soldiers. She says they don\u2019t even know if the Aiel nearby are the ones that have Faile or even if Faile is alive. Berelain insists they must know that first before doing anything else.\nElyas agrees with Berelain. He tells Perrin that they will find Faile. Elyas says that the Mayeners may find traces but he will scout himself and will find more than that. Perrin agrees and tells Elyas to go and to hurry. Elyas leaves and after a moment, Aram follows him. Masuri and Seonid send their three Warders as well, for which Perrin is grateful. \nGerard Arganda, Alliandre\u2019s First Captain, pushes forward and speaks to Perrin, but Perrin does not hear what he\u2019s saying. He reaches out to find the wolves and pleads with them to help him find Faile. The wolves mourn Perrin\u2019s loss but will not get involved; there are so many humans about that the wolves do not know of the Aiel that Perrin seeks. As the wolves fade, Arganda demands to know whether Perrin is listening; Arganda is concerned about finding his Queen. Perrin coldly informs him that they will find Alliandre when they find Faile. Perrin asks Arganda to explain himself \u2014 why are the Ghealdanin drawn up and ready to attack? Arganda says it is Aiel that took Alliandre and there are Aiel in the camp; he wants them put to questioning. Berelain says that Arganda is overwrought and she has tried to explain to him that these are not the same Aiel. Perrin angrily says that Alliandre swore fealty to him and that makes him Arganda\u2019s lord. Arganda is to question no one and touch no one without Perrin\u2019s permission. He orders Arganda to take his men back to his camp now.\n",

She hardly thinks about Perrin, except to hope he finds out Masema\u2019s secret dealings, because she is more worried about freezing. She is naked and struggling to keep up with the Shaido. There is a small chance anyone could surprise them as they are always alert. She wonders why the Shaido have not traded their green, gray and brown cadin'sor for white that would blend them into the snow. She tries to notice everything so that it can help her when she plans her escape. \nFaile tries to look back at her fellow prisoners but ends up falling into the snow. Rolan hauls her out by her hair, slaps her bottom and makes her move even faster. Faile thinks that despite being naked, Rolan does not look at her as a man looks at a woman; she is not sure how she feels about that. Faile continues marching for hours, worrying about which parts of her body will freeze off first. Her feet begin to leave bloody stains in the snow and she worries about frostbite, so she tries to wiggle her fingers and toes as much as possible. She keeps moving until she runs into Rolan. Rolan lifts her up and carries her over his shoulder.\nFaile looks back at Alliandre, Maighdin, Bain, Chiad, Arrela and Lacile. Alliandre and Maighdin are struggling, Bain and Chiad seem no worse off than the Shaido and Arrela and Lacile are trying to act like the Maidens with indifferent success. They are all being picked up and carried as well. Alliandre and Maighdin try to fight off the Aiel who are picking them up. Faile calls out to them to let themselves be carried and to obey her. Rolan tells Faile to be quiet and spanks her. Maighdin continues to resist but eventually both she and Alliandre are placed face down in the snow and switched. Both women resist, telling the Aiel they cannot do this to them; the switching continues\u200b until they are both kicking and howling. Faile has no sympathy for them\u2014they earned every stripe. It\u2019s obvious the Shaido are taking them to someplace with shelter and they need to get there.\nAs they set off through the forest, the Aiel are moving quickly. Faile is jostled and tries to find a more comfortable position to be in. Rolan tells her to be still and pats her hip. This makes Faile think a delay might not be such a bad thing if she could bite a chunk out of her captor. She recognizes the thoughts as foolish. The swaying motion from being carried begins to lull her to sleep. She has to fight it or she will die. She rhythmically works her muscles, tensing and releasing them. She thinks of Perrin and what he should do to Masema. She imagines the argument they will have when he learns she has been using Cha Faile as spies. The cold seeps into her and she begins losing concentration. Rolan keeps her awake by growling and slapping her bottom. Eventually, Faile slides off into dreams. She dreams of Perrin and of running across a vast icy wilderness.\n",

One is a gai'shain but her robes are made of silk and she is wearing a belt and collar made of gold and firedrops. The women stop in front of Faile and, with a curt gesture, dismiss their captors. Rolan hesitates for a moment and then leaves. Someryn says there are more gai\u2019shain for Sevanna and she tells Therava that Sevanna will not be satisfied until the whole world is gai\u2019shain. Therava says Sevanna has too many gai\u2019shain already. Faile thinks to herself that Therava is a dangerous woman and that she must act meek.\nAlliandre rises to her feet and announces herself and her rank. She says that she and her liege lady should be treated well as the Aiel can demand a large ransom for their return. Sevanna rides up and asks Galina, the gai\u2019shain in silk, if it is true that Alliandre is a wetlander queen. She also asks what a liege lady is. Galina explains that the liege lady would have to be a very powerful woman to have a queen swear fealty. She says this woman looks like Alliandre but she has no idea why she\u2019s here and not in Ghealdan. Therava silences Galina before she can ramble on. Faile notices that both Someryn and Therava dislike Sevanna; she thinks to herself that she has a personal claim on Sevanna for almost killing Perrin at Dumai's Wells. \nSevanna asks which of the women is the liege lady and which the liege lady\u2019s maid. Faile and Maighdin identify themselves. Sevanna studies them and finally orders Galina to heal them all so that they can walk\u2014she doesn\u2019t see why they should get to ride on the carts. Therava shoves Galina towards them telling her to do it quickly. Sevanna announces that tonight she and the Wise Ones will camp with the Jonine. Therava says that means a fifth sept has arrived while seventy eight remain scattered. She advises Sevanna to remember her pledge to reunite the Shaido because they will not wait forever. Sevanna tells Therava to remember that she is her advisor; Sevanna is the one who speaks for the clan chief! The Aiel women leave.\nGalina heals Faile and wastes no time doing the same to the others. Faile thinks furiously; why would an Aes Sedai be in the Aiel camp and in gai\u2019shain robes and ready to lick Sevanna\u2019s boots? Gai\u2019shain bring in dried meat, cheese and bread for the captives to eat. The food isn\u2019t very good but Faile eats it quickly and thinks it tastes like a feast for she is hungry. She is given a gai\u2019shain robe and boots. When an Amadician woman comes forward to put a golden belt on her Faile tells her she doesn't want it. The Amadician replies it does not matter; she serves Sevanna now and she must do as she is told. Maighdin and Alliandre are trying to fend off the collars and belts as well; Faile sighs and accepts the adornments meekly, prompting Maighdin and Alliandre to do the same. \nThe captives are soon tramping through the snow with the rest of the Aiel. Faile loses sight of Bain and Chiad. Maighdin announces firmly that they will have to find the Maidens tonight and that they are tiring themselves out trying to keep up with the Aiel\u2019s pace. Faile and Alliandre are surprised by the maid\u2019s decisiveness but Faile cannot fault her spirit. Faile agrees that tonight is the night to escape. She tells the two that if they see a chance to escape while they are traveling to take it. Both women say they will stay with her until she escapes or they will not leave at all.\n",

Elayne gives out coins to several people, and is worried about not only the finances of her people but also of that of her nation. While all people she passes halt, the cheers are few and far in between. There are, however, no jeers, a fact that calms Elayne to some extent. Her entourage, consisting of the Brown sister, her Warder and altogether eight Guardswomen clad in the rather elaborate dress of Elayne's honour guard, attract their own attention, and as they pass through the streets of Caemlyn Sareitha gives Elayne a lecture on how the streets are not safe for her and how the ten sisters currently in the Silver Swan do not bode well. Elayne brushes the Brown's various fears away, but inside she is not as calm as she appears. \nAs she rides through the city she also ponders the fact that some of the fugitives from the war-ridden or occupied neighbouring countries seem to have returned to themselves in the sense that they have taken up their own crafts again. Not only does it help these individuals to provide for themselves, it also reduces the need to import wares from other countries and has the additional advantage of the taxes being a possible income in the future. Some, or even most of the fugitives, though, are not only unable to fend for themselves, some of them are even unable or unwilling to accept the help they are being given. While soup kitchens have been set up for the poor, no one can make people accept them. \nThose she notices most, though, are the many mercenaries and merchant's guards wandering the streets. Whether Andoran or foreign, they are armed, and since there are so many of them that their \"normal\" professions are full, Elayne decides that getting some of them to sign up for the army should not be too much trouble. Mostly, she is concerned with two things; how to make sure the Guards remain mostly Andoran, and how to find enough coin to pay them. As she thinks about this she becomes aware of the strong emotions of her Warder Birgitte, and the combination of her strong emotions and the speed with which she returns to the palace sets \"the alarm gongs ringing\" in Elayne's head and she hurries back to the palace by the most direct route in order to meet her there. \n",

Halwin Norry, the Head Clerk, wishes to speak to her, and the animosity or, rather, jealousy between the two concerning their jobs is evident to Elayne. Others asking for an appointment including several merchants, and Mistress Harfor advises her on how to deal with them in a way that makes Elayne thinks about how her mother, the former Queen Morgase, used to say that she ruled Andor but thought the Head Maid ruled her. After the two Kinswomen Solain Morgeillin and Keraille Surtovni pass them, Mistress Harfor also mentions that \"Mistress Corly\" has requested a meeting, and instead of taking the files the Head Maid asked her to sign before they are sent to the Head Clerk into her apartment, Elayne asks that the files be left there and heads out to find the former Eldest of the Knitting Circle, which is, or rather used to be, the ruling body of the Kin. \nIn the hallways she runs into Vandene, followed closely and meekly by the two elderly novices Zarya and Kirstian. They have, in spite of their rather intensive training and strict discipline, been able to learn that the murderer of Vandene's sister Adeleas must be one of three sisters; Merilille, Sareitha or Careane.

Nynaeve and Lan appear just in time to hear the brief discussion, however, and because Nynaeve is stronger enough in the One Power that Vandene is supposed to defer to her, Vandene ends up with that chore herself.

She reminds herself to make sure Birgitte is there, and allows herself to notice a \"heated knot of irritation\" before going out into her sitting room where the First Clerk, Norry, awaits her. His first piece of news, the find of first quality alum at Danabar, is good news, because its prospective income will mean that the bankers are far more likely to agree to loan the kingdom of Andor some much-needed funds to, among other things, build up the needed army to secure the throne for Elayne. There are, of course, expenses to be taken into account, but master Norry still agrees that both the Guard as well as the  Academy can now be looked into without too much worry. \nThe next topic is the Dragon Reborn and Elaida's proclamation acknowledging him and offering him \"protection and guidance\" as well as pronouncing anathema on anyone approaching him save through the Tower. The proclamation stuns Elayne, and so does the news that someone attacked the Sun Palace using the One Power, and that Rand is gone. Norry's source suggests that Rand has probably gone to kneel at Elaida's feet, but Elayne refuses to believe he would even kneel to Egwene and that Elaida has as much chance as \"a goat at a court ball\". \nHis other pieces of news are either outdated or Elayne perceives them as unimportant; the latter includes news of Sea Folk ships making their way through the Fingers of the Dragon without pilots and fighting the Seanchan at sea; Illian being quiet and full of Rand's soldiers, assumed to be recovering from a battle against the Seanchan, the Queen of Saldaea still being on her long retreat in the country, the Queen of Kandor having been out of Chachin for months. Elayne asks for his advice, but merely, it seems, out of politeness since she already knows what to do about it - nothing. His last piece of news concerns the fact that King Roedran is gathering an army in Lugard, and when it comes to this aspect Halwin Norry surprises Elayne by seeming almost hesitant before giving his advice. Again it is to do nothing, but that is because Elayne has not yet been crowned Queen of Andor and thus cannot expect an emissary of hers to ever reach the King since that might mean repercussions for him if another contestant for the throne is able to get rid of Elayne. Elayne decides to calm Norry down, however, and tells him about Roedran's aims as she has been told by Egwene. \nThis impresses Norry, and he \"remembers\" something he left out in his first round; the fact that Cairhienin nobles are pondering coming to Andor to help her claim the throne there so that she can come to Cairhien quickly and claim her birthright from her father Taringail as well. Elayne thanks him and tells him to write out a letter ready for her signature and seal, in which she states that she will come to Cairhien once she has time and implies that the Cairhienin nobles should keep out of Andor since anything else would only worsen the strained relationship between the two nations. She says nothing straight out, of course, but feels assured that the smarter among the noble Houses will understand and explain it to those who are not as smart. \n",

Stepping out of her cabin Tuon meets her damane. She punished one of them last night after she asked the damane to tell the future for her.

Tuon prides herself for being able to train damane with the best of the sul'dam. \nOn deck the members of the blood meet her as well as members of the Deathwatch Guard, dedicated to her personal protection. The Macura woman is on deck too. She sold them some valuable information but her hatred against Aes Sedai goes deep and she is looking for opportunities to do them more damage. \nOn the Quarterdeck her truthspeaker Anath is waiting for her. She immediately notices the veil and begins to tell her just how silly she is acting. The truthspeaker's job is to tell you just that, plain and simple, whether you want to hear it or not. Tuon is still not comfortable with Anath though. Her previous truthspeaker died less then two years ago. Anath's appointment was a bit of a surprise but nobody questions the Empress, may she live forever. After Anath is done telling her just how silly the veil is Tuon informs her she will not need penance. \n",

She demands three sisters go with her as a start to the payment of previous bargains. \nElayne notes dismally that without the Windfinders' strength, Caemlyn will soon begin to go hungry, as most of the Kin are not strong enough to hold a gateway. \n",

Quickly, Elayne changes into a formal gown and jewellery and teases Aviendha into doing the same. \nUpon entering the formal sitting room, Elayne is introduced to the High Seats that have chosen to follow her, only to feel her spirits drop when realizing the four before her are little more than children with no advisers present. \nElayne fields questions and barely concealed insults from the group while being vague about subjects like the Kin and introducing them to her sister, Aviendha. \nAfter the four leave, Birgitte and Aviendha both barrage Dyelin with questions and comments on children leading, to which Dyelin speaks of taking her place as High Seat at fifteen due to her father's and her brothers' deaths.

Tallanvor introduces the two parties formally. The Seanchan are lead by Tylee Khirgan and Bakayar Mishima. When she sees him, Tylee is glad that Perrin is not introduced as the Wolf King, because a line from the Seanchan version of the Prophecies of the Dragon says: \"When the Wolf King carries the hammer, thus are the final days known. When the fox marries the raven, and the trumpets of battle are blown.\" \nTylee asks Berelain about her name, which hints at a connection to Artur Paendrag. She would be honored by the Empress for being from the same descendants as long as she didn't claim the land the Seanchan are about to reclaim. Berelain answers proudly that she is indeed a descendant of Artur Paendrag and that she only claims Mayene, which she will defend to her last breath. \nBoth parties have many more men in the woods than was agreed on.

Faile thinks about past punishments and intends not to add another one. She wants to seem tamed, but is afraid that if she pretends too long, it will actually happen. She wants to escape before Perrin catches up to them, but at the same time she wonders why he hasn't caught up yet. \nSevanna complains about Galina being punished too much, but she is not concerned about Galina's well being. Galina's state makes it impossible for her to order punishments when they would be appropriate. Apparently all of Galina's hair has been singed off with the One Power. Faile wonders how an Aes Sedai could let herself be treated like that. Galina is sitting between Sevanna and Therava, looking at the latter in panic. She is being treated so harshly that even some of the Shaido say it is too much. She looks broken. Faile worries about Galina not being able to fulfil her promise to take them with her when she leaves.

She offers wine to Therava, who still prefers to drink water. \nFaile worries about having too many people swear fealty to her. Lusara, a Domani merchant, treats their plans for escape like a children's game, jeopardizing everything. \nTherava says that the Wise Ones want to move north and east, since Malden is attackable and food is not easy to come by any more. Sevanna wants to stay because of the good soil for planting, pastures and water. Therava answers that some think Sevanna wants to be captured by Rand to entice him to marry her. Sevanna angrily affirms that she will indeed marry him and unite the clans. Therava doesn't approve of Rand, especially since he revealed the Aiel's secrets, which many of the Aiel believe to be lies. Clearly questioning Sevanna's authority, she points out that Sevanna wouldn't know, since she never went to Rhuidean. Sevanna threatens Therava back by questioning her loyalty and stressing the importance of reuniting the clans. She violently orders that the Shaido stay where they are. \nMeanwhile the new gai'shain enter the tent to relieve the current ones. Faile is replaced by Doirmanes, a Cairhienin nobleman, who is so eager to please Sevanna that he would have to be killed, should he ever find out about the oaths of fealty that have been sworn to Faile. While she leaves the tent, she hears Therava tell Sevanna that Bendhuin, sept chief of the Green Salts, has gotten permission to go to Rhuidean. He will replace Sevanna once he returns. Sevanna is furious at not being informed, but since she is not a clan chief, only speaking for one as a widow, there was no need to tell her. \nFaile walks toward her tent thinking about her situation. Planning has been difficult because Sevanna decides on her servants' tasks at a very short notice. In general, it is difficult to find enough chores for all the gai'shain. There are fourteen septs camped in Malden. The camp holds one hundred thousand Shaido and the same amount of gai'shain. Two more septs, the Morai and the White Cliffs, are arriving shortly. \nMeira, another Wise One, strides towards Faile. She went looking for her because she thought Faile had been dragged into a tent by a drunk. Even though it is against custom, gai'shain are assaulted regularly. Faile and her friends are being protected by Rolan and some of the other Mera'din. Meira commands Faile to tell her everything that Sevanna said and did that morning.

Joline and Edesina have found the same loophole in his protection that Adeleas and Vandene had and he is afflicted by rocks thrown at him and sparks of fire weaved at him. Joline and Teslyn get into an argument that clears Edesina, Bethamin and Seta out of the wagon. He notices that the rocks and sparks from Joline have stopped afterward. Joline and Edesina try to bully Mat into handing over the Foxhead medallion. Mistress Anan tells Mat that Joline would face a fairly harsh penance for theft if she took it from him forcefully. She asks to see the ter'angreal. Mat lets her look at it and allows her to touch it. Mat guesses that she was once Aes Sedai and she admits it, telling Mat that her husband, Jasfer, found her sick on the streets of Ebou Dar and took her to his mother. Setalle guesses that Mat is besotted with Tuon. Mat and Setalle agree to keep each other's secrets.\n",

Bennae has her perform some weaves, with which she has no problem and then says she wishes to see if Egwene has the sharpness of mind required of an Aes Sedai.  She asks how Egwene would react if she were in conflict with her Ajah because she had come into  some information she wasn't supposed to know. Egwene realises Bennae is talking about herself.  She tells Bennae that from the perspective of the Ajah leaders it would suggest a leak amongst their most trusted members. Egwene says she'd explain where the information really came from and offer them a solution, that they make her one of the caretakers of the information. Bennae bows her head in thanks, even after Egwene calls her by her name.\nAfter leaving Bennae, she is taken to Nagora, who frames a request for advice on dealing with an aging Warder as a logical puzzle.  She is also impressed.  Next, Egwene is taken to Suana, the first Sitter she has dealt with.  Suana tells Egwene they would like her in the Yellow, even with her lack of Healing ability as being Yellow is about making and fixing things, not just Healing people.  Egwene takes the opportunity to reach out to her about healing the divisions within within the Tower, suggesting that Sitters of different Ajahs might begin taking meals together, or walking in each other's company. She leaves, again without punishment to go to Meidani's room.\nMeidani tells Egwene she is not certain how she regards her, having been captured and overthrown.  Egwene tells her she is still Amyrlin and knows for a fact that the rebels haven't chosen a replacement.  She demands to know why Meidani did not flee the Tower when Elaida discovered she was a spy, but Meidani tells her she cannot say.  Egwene realises the Three Oaths are involved and asks if Meidani can show her instead.  She has Meidani promise that she accepts her leadership and that she will not reveal the weave to anyone, and shows her how to Travel. They go through the gateway, hearing rats and Meidani warns her it could be dangerous.  They go to one of the rooms and see Saerin, Yukiri, Doesine and Seaine.\nEgwene realises they had made Meidani swear a fourth oath and calls it insanity. Saerin replies that it was necessity, not insanity.  Yukiri threatens Egwene, barely in control of her anger, but Egwene replies that the rebels are not to blame for the divisions within the Tower.  Seaine tells Egwene they are looking for the Black Ajah. Egwene decides their plan is reasonable, but that making Aes Sedai swear the oath of obedience is not. Egwene questions them and Yukiri tells her she will set penance until she runs out of tears.  Egwene tells her it can't be any more than she has already and that even if it was set, it would draw attention to the group.  Seaine says they would get Meidani to do it, but Meidani and Egwene both say she accepts Egwene as Amyrlin.  Yukiri says they could order Meidani to do it, but Egwene reminds her the fourth oath was supposed to prevent Meidani from betraying them, not to control her in a way just short of compulsion. Yukiri continues her refusal to deal with Egwene, but Saerin insists they do as Egwene won't stop otherwise.\n",

                    "Summary": "Egwene shells walnuts for the three Whites. Ferane asks her what she would have done in Elaida's situation. Egwene says she would have sent sisters to Rand's home village to learn what sort of man he is. She tells them she knows Rand to be a good man at heart and would have sent sisters to offer guidance or spies if he rejected them. She tells them he has restored order to Cairhien, Tear and Illian and gained the respect of the Aiel.  Ferane interprets this that Egwene would let him sow chaos, but she says without information, what Elaida did was lunacy.  \nFerane tells Egwene that she still has not said how she would deal with the situation. She says she would send three Aes Sedai to honour him, a Gray, a Blue and a Green.  Tesan is impressed with her logic. Egwene says that Elaida's delegation is flawed because it was sent by a Red and that she can't see the logic of raising a Red to Amyrlin in the days of the Dragon Reborn, as they \"deal with\", not \"work with\" men. Ferane sees the sense in this.\nEgwene mentions that because of Elaida's bungling he has taken some Aes Sedai captive and allowed others to be bonded by Asha'man.  Egwene tells her that they can't deal with Rand until the White Tower is mended.  Ferane says that by continuing to claim to be Amyrlin, Egwene maintains the division. Egwene replies that even if she renounced the role and persuaded the rebels to accept Elaida, the internal divisions would still hold.  Miyasi claims the Whites didn't cause the tension, but Egwene says it is only logical given Elaida and the Hall's actions.  She persuades them to reach out to other sisters.  She tells them that Suana of the Yellow will invite them to dinner with her and they should accept and take it in a public place.  Ferane tells her she would find a welcome in the White.\nShe leaves and Katerine doses her with forkroot, telling her that she is to have no more lessons and instead will just do chores. In the kitchens, Laras takes her to a fireplace to store her until night when she intends to help Egwene escape.  Egwene refuses saying that someone has to fight Elaida.  After her duties, Katerine tells her she is to attend Elaida that night.  At dinner, Egwene sees there are five other Aes Sedai, a Sitter from each Ajah apart from Blue and Red.  Shevan says that the rebels must be given a chance to reconcile. Elaida refuses and insults first the Gray, then Rubinde. Shevan mentions the Seanchan and Elaida says there is no need to worry about them.  She instructs Egwene to say she has been spreading lies but Egwene tells the truth, that she is a Dreamer and that the Seanchan will attack the Tower and are a serious threat.  She is told to bow or Elaida will use the Power to make her. Egwene asks if she intends to control everyone that way and brings up the fourth oath Elaida had considered.  Elaida starts to weave a gag of air, but Egwene says an Amyrlin should be able to persuade her opponents, impressing Yukiri. She quotes Balladare Arandaille on the role of an Amyrlin, impressing Shevan and asks Elaida what she had intended to do with Rand if she had succeeded in capturing him and asks her how she expected him to fulfill the prophecies.  She says she has been trying to heal the scars within the Tower while Elaida has been bullying Sitters and insulting Ajahs.  Doesine murmurs agreement and Elaida realises she has lost the discussion and ends it.\n",

Later on she serves at a dinner Elaida has with five Sitters. She confronts Elaida about the way she is ruling the Tower, eventually calling her a coward. Elaida beats her senselessly and proclaims that Egwene is a Darkfriend. \n"

She gives him a dossier showing how crime has decreased and how much more stable and safe Altara is since the Seanchan took over.  He considers it briefly, then swears fealty, though not in the Seanchan way.

Mat is expounding on how impossible women are using a game of dice as an example. Vanin rides up with a map in his hand. Mats asks if Vanin has figured out where they are and Vanin is not sure. It depends on what mountain it is that is ahead of them but he thinks he knows where they are. Mat lets Vanin ride off to scout thinking to himself that if Vanin were to spy on an enemy army he'd get close enough to count the whiskers on the camp guards' beards and make off with their stew, too, all without being seen.\nAs Vanin leaves, Mat hurries to catch up with Talmanes and thinks to himself how ridiculous the Cairhien man looks in his Cairhienin clothing. Even if the man was loyal and had excellent taste in wine, he still had horrid taste in fashion. Talmanes mentions the Band's great victories but Mat says that one thousand men buried is not a victory. Talmanes says losses are inevitable. Mat says there are only losses when one fights. Talmanes asks why Mat fights so often then, and Mat says he only fights when he cannot avoid it. Mat thinks to himself how impossible noblemen are; even decent ones like Talmanes.\nThis sets Mat to thinking about his own title he got by marrying Tuon. He wonders if the Seanchan will pursue him. He knows Tuon knows what his Band is capable of. Then he wonders if Tuon loves him. Yes, she did stay with him when she could have escaped but if it were best for her Empire he is certain she would attack him.  Thinking about Tuon's narrow escape from Seanchan soldiers after the reward money placed on her head fills Mat with conflicting emotions about letting her go and he mentions it. Talmanes says Mat did give his word and the Captain of the Deathwatch Guard wouldn't have taken it well had Mat tried to keep her. Mat is not reassured and Talmanes tells him he's sounding husbandly; Mat does not take well to this.\nMat asks Talmanes if he's ever been in love or wanted to marry. Talmanes says he's been in love several times but never married, thank the Light. Talmanes realizes what he just said and tries to soothe Mat saying Mat's marriage will work. Mat thinks about how inconvenient his marriage to Tuon is and says that no matter what he won't stop gambling or drinking. Talmanes teases him about this with a straight face but humor in his eyes. Mat says he isn't going soft no matter what anyone says. Talmanes says some of the greatest generals alive are married.\nMat tells Talmanes that when they get to town he and Talmanes are going dicing.

She offers to open it for him so he can get round his promise to do as it says, but he tells her he would still be bound by it. He leaves the inn, for another, of lower quality, The Dead Man's Breath.  There, he hears that a local man, Jowdry has been murdered, with his throat ripped out and drained of blood. Mat realises the gholam is near. He leaves and heads for another inn, The Two Apples, where Thom is performing. Thom has heard about the gholam and they head back to Mat's camp.\nOn the way, they discuss Elayne, who hasn't replied to Mat, and the Tower of Ghenjei. Mat intends to find an Aes Sedai to Travel there. He is told by Gufrin that the three Aes Sedai have returned, which does not please him, but Teslyn approaches him. She asks him if he has heard any rumors, which he has, but he puts no stock in any of them.  She agrees and tells him they are going back to the White Tower, even Edesina. She thanks him, tells him there are women in the White Tower in his debt and gives him a respectful nod. He tells her he can spare her horses to speed the journey.\nHe leaves her to open his tent, where he smells blood.\n",

Mat calls for help hoping the crowd will scare the gholam off. The fight quickly moves out of the tent and Mat wraps his Foxhead medallion ter'angreal around his ashandarei so he can use it to injure the gholam. Mat slightly injures the gholam and the gholam tells him it has also been instructed to kill Thom, Noal, and Tuon to draw Mat out which startles Mat enough that it leaves an opening that the gholam tries to take advantage of but Teslyn shows up and uses weaves of air to tear the knife out of the gholam's hand and pull Mat backwards. Teslyn uses weaves of air to throw furniture at the gholam which scares it off. As the gholam runs away it encounters a couple of Redarm guards, Gorderan and Fergin, and easily dodges them and tears their throats out. Mat returns to his tent to see whose blood was there and discovers Lopin, Riddem, and Will Reeve dead. He then searches for Olver and runs into Noal who tells him Olver is sleeping on his floor.\nAn hour later Mat tells Noal and Thom about his encounter with the gholam and warns them of its threats towards them. Derry, a guard who was missing for several days, was found dead outside the camp and they presume he was the one who told the gholam about Tuon. Thom, Noal, and Mat decide to hunt the gholam but in the meantime will move into the city and stay at a different inn each night and let it be known in case the gholam is listening. Joline shows up and asks Mat to lend her some horses as she will be returning to the White Tower.\n",

Noting that his eyes do not look young but when he smiles she recognizes his smile. Min tells him that Alanna has gone missing and they are afraid because she knows where to find Rand. Rand states that Alanna is somewhere northward and that the Shadow doesn't need her to find him. Rand acknowledges the Aiel and tells them that he has toh to meet. Rhuarc tells him the story of the meegerling and asks him if he is such a creature. Rand promises to never leave the Aiel again and to always have an Aiel guard unless it is with their permission. Rand walks with Darlin and asks him who is there as well as to get him some messengers. Rand tells someone to go get Cadsuane and that he will not execute her. He then orders Narishma to tell the Borderlanders that he will meet with them. He then tells them to announce that Egwene has succeeded Elaida as the Amyrlin. Rand now turns to Min and asks her to find out what part Callandor has to play. He then turns to Cadsuane and pardons her as well as apologizes, explaining to her he has realized he is not a weapon. He then asks her for a favor to go hunt someone but does not tell her who, explaining that he will tell her later when less ears are around. Rand then has the high Lords and Ladies line up. As he goes down the line he tells Weiramon to look into his eyes. After Weiramon looks into his eyes he turns towards Anaiyella and tells them both to leave and tell their associates that they can no longer hide, he is blind no longer. Tam then shows up and Rand goes up to him crying, gives him a hug and apologizes. Tam forgives him and Rand says he wants to introduce Min. Tam says he already met her but Rand says he needs to introduce her telling Tam that she is very special to him.\n",

                    "Summary": "Nynaeve is led by Rosil to where she will take the Aes Sedai test. There is one member from each Ajah there to administer the test as well as Egwene. Rosil shows her a six pointed star that she is supposed to go to when she sees it. She tells her she is supposed to go to the sign and can not use the power before and must complete all the weaves before she leaves. When she has completed her task she will see the sign again directing her to where she must go. \nNynaeve steps in and finds herself on a beach next to a mountain with ash and smoke coming out. She hear people scream but she sees the sign and knows she must walk there. As she is doing it a large shower of stones falls towards her and she performs the first weave, a wall of air. She then turns to go help the people in the village but sees the sign on a hut. She walks trough the hut doorway and finds herself in a cavern. She walks out of the cavern and finds herself in the Waste. The heat is overwhelming but she walks over to some ruins and sees a rock in the formation of the sign. As she walks towards it she hears sounds and looks up to see Trollocs rushing towards her. She walks faster towards the rocks but does not run. She reaches the rocks and sends off a weave of fire completing the weave and sets it in place. She then sees an archway of stone with the six star sign on it and walks over and steps through.\nNynaeve finishes her forty-seventh weave which causes the sound of bells in the air. She is on top of a very narrow tower with wind blowing strongly. She sees an archway appear below her with the sign and jumps down through it. She finds herself naked and with cuts on her arms from being whipped. Her determinations kicks in and she gets up finds clothes and puts them on. She walks until she finds a six pointed star in the mud. Flies start to appear and flying around her and she starts to form a weave of air when she hears a scream. She starts to walk towards the sound but when she opens her mouth flies fly in. She remembers that she has to finish her weave and does forming a weave of air to push the flies back. She sees the sign above a door carved into a tree. Nynaeve walks down the hallway she found herself in. She finds a door and opens it to discover 4 children who are very sick. She decides to heal them but then remembers she can't. She then notices a room across the hall with a rug with the sign on it. She walks over leaving the children behind and completes the weave she is supposed to. She can hear the crying children but has to go on. She sees a door with the sign and walks to it.\nNynaeve's challenges get harder as she leaves people to drown, be beheaded, be buried alive, and she has to form a weave while giant spiders consume villagers. She stumbles through a doorway after completing her eightieth weave. She finds herself in the Two Rivers where people she knows are being attacked by shadowspawn bigger than Trollocs. Perrin calls for her to help but she sees the sign on a hillside and walks towards it but then then thinks that it's stupid and runs to the sign so she can channel, she decides she doesn't need to get to the star she needs to help her friends so she reaches for Saidar but finds something trying to block her but forces her way past it and uses Saidar to fling fire at the monsters. Attacking the monsters as she ran she reaches the star and forms the eighty-first weave which creates big fire rings she sends at the creatures. She then sees the sign on the roof of the inn and heads for it. She runs there feeling like a coward and goes through the door.\nNynaeve is on the last of the weaves she finds herself in a room. She finds an Accepted dress but leaves it thinking she's not Accepeted. She then finds a yellow dress and puts it on. She looks down upon broken rubble and lakes and realizes she is in Malkier. She sees the star below her feet and starts to form the last weave when she sees Lan being attacked by Darkhounds. She finishes the weave and sees a sign above the door of a shack. She starts to walk towards it but looks back at Lan who is fighting the Darkhounds. She decides to help him and starts throwing weaves of fire at them but the fire does nothing to them. She then draws a bunch of Saidar and made a weave of Balefire. She balefires a bunch of the Darkhounds and then balefires the ground in front of them causing the Darkhounds to fall in. She heads to the doorway with Lan and steps through and lands on the floor back in the Tower surrounded by the Aes Sedai. Rosil heals her. Saerin asks what happened saying she has never seen anyone put through what Nynaeve was put through. Barasine replies that it doesn't matter, that she failed. Lelaine agrees saying she did not show the calm of an Aes Sedai. Nynaeve tells them what she thought about it and walks over to Egwene. Egwene tells her she shouldn't have been able to channel but her time in the world of dreams and that the ter'angreal functions in the same way causing what's in your mind to be real. Egwene admits to being the one behind the Two Rivers scene and the Lan scene but Nynaeve says she is glad it showed her she would chose Lan over Aes Sedai and that without Lan she would never be herself. Saerin asks Nynaeve to swear to not use Balefire but she refuses saying she may need it when she fights at Shayol Ghul. Egwene points out to the rest that Nynaeve helped cleanse Saidin, defeated Moghedien, and is married to the king of Malkier. Yukiri, Seaine, Romanda, and Saerin vote that she passes and Rubinde, Barasine, and Lelaine vote no. With four yes' Nynaeve has passes the test. Rosil tells her she must pray and contemplate the burdens she will take upon receiving the shawl the next day. Nynaeve tells her she has something to do first.\nNynaeve makes a gateway and travels to the ouside of the Black Tower where she meets Myrelle. She tells Myrelle she passed the test and demands Lan's bond saying she is free of the oaths for one more day. Myrells passes the bond.\n",

Aside from Ailil, they are mainly those who rose to prominence by neither supporting Rand strongly, nor opposing him.

Lorstrum and Bertome are the first to see what she is hinting and agree to her plan.  Lady Osiellin and Lord Mavabwin are next and Elayne tells them she could divide the final estate between them.  She then offers Elenia lands in Cairhien, which Elenia says she will consider.  Lorstrum and Bertome go back to Cairhien to arrange giving the crown to Elayne.\nAfter they leave, Morgase and Dyelin explain to Birgitte that it gained Elayne the throne of Cairhien but that it also strengthened Lorstrum and Bertome enough that they may make a play for one of the thrones eventually.

Mat calls out to the Finns telling them they knew he would come back. Thom says they could not have known but Mat insists that they do. An Eelfinn appears calling Mat the son of battles. He tells them he can take them where they wish to go for a price. A female appears and then another male who tells Mat he has brought out their most skilled. There were dozens of them now all talking about making bargains but Mat refuses to make a bargain until they get to the Chamber of Bonds. Mat swings at one but his weapon goes through it. Thom throws a knife at one and it hits. Mat swings at another one but using the iron side this time and slices open one of them. The Finns start appearing on both sides of them. One group distracting trying to give the group on the other side a chance to attack. Thom throws knives at them but Mat tells him to stop telling him they are trying to get them to waste the knives. Mat lights a nightflower and throws it. As it goes off it blinds the Finns and Mat turns around with his eyes closed, opens them and heads down the corridor in front of him. They continue straight and end up in a room that is star-shaped with eight tips and only one doorway with eight empty pedestals, one at each point and Moiraine is floating in the middle. Mat reaches into the mist that is holding Moiraine and pulls back quickly because it is hot. Thom reaches in and Mat warns him but he doesn't care. Thom pulls her out and wraps her in his cloak. He takes off a bracelet she is wearing saying it looks like a ter'angreal but an Eelfinn responds saying it's an angreal almost strong enough to be a sa'angreal and that it can be part of her price if they wish to pay it. There are now four male and four female Eelfinn on the pedestals. As part of the bargain Mat demands the way out restored back where it was and open again and that they have to leave the way out open until they get through. No blocking it up or making it vanish when they arrive. With the way direct, with no changing rooms about. A straight pathway and the Eelfinns can't knock them unconscious or try to kill them or anything like that and that they get to take Moiraine. They ask him what price he will pay. He tells them he will give them half the light of the world. They jump from their pedestals and rush him. When Thom and Noal move towards them he tells them to stop that it must be done or they will kill them. One of the Finns sticks its claws in Mats eye socket and rip his eye right out. They are left heading straight down the hallways and as they are walking Noal brings up the fact that when Mat made the bargain he demanded that the Foxes couldn't attack them but he didn't mention the Snakes, the Aelfinn, and ahead of them they see several dozen of them.

Noal asks Mat to use another cylinder but he tells him that was the last one. Thom brings up the fact that the Finns had told Mat about his eye, he asks Mat if they told him anything else that might help but Mat says they just threw him out through the doorway in Tear. They continue on till Noal tells them he is going to delay the Aelfinn so Mat can use his luck to find a way out. He tells them that if they ever see a Malkieri to tell him that Jain Farstrider died clean. They take off and shortly enter another room where Mat spins using his luck and faces the way he came. They follow it and end up in a new room with yellow columns made in the shape of enormous vines twisting around one another with an open cylinder of space at the center, with lamp stands that held globes of white that give the room a soft light, and the floor is tiled in the pattern of white and yellow strips, spiraling out from the center. It is the room where Mat received his answers. He sees the doorway into the other room or the rubble left by it, it had been shattered. Moiraine wakes up but Mat is trying to figure out how to get out. Thom starts playing music which slows the Aelfinn down and Mat ponders on the last time he escaped. He realizes that when he asked to be free of them he got the ashandarei. He then sticks the ashandarei into the wall and carves a triangle and a wavy line it opens a doorway and the Aelfinn pull back. They step through and Mat says that it looks like you can win the game.\n",
