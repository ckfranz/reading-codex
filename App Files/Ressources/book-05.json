The Seat is traditionally held by a woman strong both in the Power and in her character. The vote to choose an Amyrlin must be unanimous, as must the vote to depose one. Once chosen, the Amyrlin is said to be “of all Ajahs and none”—all previous affiliations with Ajah are ignored (at least in theory). The Ajahs get fairly equal numbers of Amyrlins raised from their Ajah, with two exceptions: no Amyrlin has been raised from the Red Ajah since [Bonwhin](#Bonwhin-Meraighdin), who was deposed and stilled for nearly breaking the Tower in [Artur Hawkwing](#High-King-Artur-Hawkwing)'s day, except for [Elaida a'Roihan](#Elaida-do-Avriny-a-Roihan), the current Amyrlin Seat in Tar Valon; the Blue Ajah has had more than the average number of Amyrlins from its Ajah—four of the last five Amyrlins (not counting Elaida) were raised from the Blue Ajah. These two exceptions to the mean number of Amyrlins from one's Ajah have only added to the friction between the Blue and Red Ajahs over the years. The Amyrlin has a secretary of sorts, the [Keeper of the Chronicles](#Keeper-of-the-Chronicles), who is traditionally chosen from the same Ajah that the Amyrlin was raised from. The office was held by [Siuan Sanche](#Siuan-Sanche), raised from the Blue Ajah, until she was deposed for her involvement with events surrounding the [Dragon Reborn](#Dragon-Reborn).

Bonwhin was stripped of stole and staff and stilled for nearly destroying the Tower, and since then no Amyrlin from her Ajah has been raised. She was succeeded by Deane Aryman of the Blue Ajah, who attempted to undo the damage Bonwhin did to the Tower's reputation, and succeeded for the most part. Unfortunately, this created extreme tension between the Red and Blue Ajahs that still exists today, and is the main reason why the Red Ajah will (and did) take any pretext to pull down an Amyrlin raised from the Blue Ajah."

She had this Foretelling during the time after [Tigraine](#Lady-Tigraine-Mantear) disappeared and threw Andor into its third war of Succession—Elaida attached herself to Morgase as soon as it became apparent that she would be the one who would take the Throne. However, since there was really no definite royal family at the time, the Foretelling could have concerned the previous royal family, that of [Mordrellen](#Queen-Mordrellen-Mantear), [Tigraine](#Lady-Tigraine-Mantear), and [Taringail](#Lord-Taringail-Damodred).

Galad has much skill with the sword, and has acheived Blademaster status in practice if not in name. He disappeared from Tar Valon during the violence that accompanied [Siuan](#Siuan-Sanche)'s deposition and joined [Eamon Valda](#Lord-Captain-Eamon-Valda)'s band of the Children of the Light. Because of his sword skill, Galad was promoted to an official position very quickly, and now controls his own small band of men. He says he became a Whitecloak because it “felt right.” He is extremely virtuous, and will do whatever he thinks is right regardless of who it hurts, even himself. His sign is a winged silver sword, point down."

During the chaos that erupted after [Siuan Sanche](#Siuan-Sanche)'s deposition, Gawyn formed a band of young men, everyone who had trained with the Warders except Galad, who are called the Younglings. The Younglings fought back against their teachers, who were trying to free Siuan and [Leane](#Leane-Sharif) from their imprisonment. Gawyn himself killed Hammar and Coulin, the men in charge of teaching the sword and for his personal training, respectively, both of which are Blademasters—few Warders are as good as they were, and Gawyn managed to kill both of them. Gawyn did not know which party to support—he believes that anyone who opposes Tower Law by trying to free Siuan and Leane is wrong, but at the same time he does not know all the facts surrounding the change in leadership. In fact, his sister Elayne and her friends [Nynaeve al'Meara](#Nynaeve-al-Meara) and [Egwene al'Vere](#Egwene-al-Vere) side with those who broke from the Tower. This is especially difficult since Gawyn has feelings for Egwene, feelings which she returns. However, he is afraid to speak up because Galad has similar feelings. His sign is a white boar."

On the way to Tar Valon, he picked up a dagger from Shadar Logoth tainted with the evil that destroyed Aridhol, which he carried with him for a long time. He was separated from the dagger by Aes Sedai Healing, but doing so caused large gaps in his memory sequence. These gaps were filled and more when he passed through the twisted door to the land of the Eelfinn, where he was granted his three requests: a foxhead medallion that protected him from women's channeling, a way out of the land of the Eelfinn, and the memories of past lifetimes that were the gaps in his memory. Mat's _ta'veren_ qualities manifest themselves particularly well with random events, such as dice games—he almost never loses a toss of the dice, even if the dice are weighted. He has found that battles are the ultimate form of gambling, and along with his newfound memories he can win almost every battle he fights quite decisively. He has four sisters, including Eldrin and Bodewhin, who are 16 and 17, respectively. His father Abell is one of the best archers in the Two Rivers, possibly in the World. Mat has gotten in the habit of carrying concealed knives under his clothes in case he is attacked—his collection would surprise anyone.

She can only touch the True Source when she is extremely angry. She went, along with [Egwene](#Egwene-al-Vere) and [Elayne](#Elayne-Trakand), to Tear to hunt down [Liandrin](#Liandrin) and the rest of the sisters that left the Tower and declared themselves Black Ajah. On the way she freed [Amathera](#Amathera-Aelfdene-Casmir-Lounault) from them, as well as defeating [Moghedien](#Moghedien). Moghedien got free, and now hunts Nynaeve with a passion for revenge. Nynaeve has strong feelings for [Lan](#al-Lan-Mandragoran), feelings which he returns; she can hardly wait for the time when [Moiraine](#Moiraine-Damodred) releases him from his bond so she can have him to herself. She wants to become Aes Sedai for the sole purpose of Healing people; she thinks the Tower meddles in the affairs of others far too much, but she does need it to learn the skills necessary to help others. She is determined to find a way to Heal everything short of death—she will not be convinced that anything short of that cannot be Healed, including stilling, gentling, and the wound on [Rand](#Rand-al-Thor)'s side."

Fain's look has that effect on Myrddraal—Fades feel the same fear of Fain as men feel from a Fade. _Machin Shin_, the Black Wind of the Ways which is perfectly alright with consuming Trollocs alive, did not consume Fain's soul, instead welcoming him as an old friend.
