She has green eyes, and is of age with Rand and [Mat](#Matrim-Mat-Cauthon). She is more than pretty with her dark reddish hair. Aviendha is one of the three women in [Min](#Elmindreda-Min-Farshaw)'s viewing of Rand—she also saw that she was to fall in love with him when she went through the three rings in Rhuidean. She denied her feelings for him at first, but when the wagons crossed the Dragonwall toward Cairhien, sweat tents became unavailable and she tried bathing as “wetlanders” did; Rand came in as she was standing before the bath in her skin, and she panicked. She created a Traveling gateway to southern Seanchan (she does not remember how), trying to get as far away from Rand as possible, into the middle of winter. When Rand rescued her, she decided she could not hide her feelings any longer, and the two ended up spending the night in each other's arms before coming back. Aviendha says a similar incident will not occur, and punished any Maiden who made a crack about it (how they found out about something that occurred on the far side of the world on another continent is a different subject entirely). She felt _toh_ toward [Elayne](#Elayne-Trakand) for violating her trust, but upon hearing that Elayne would consent to being her sister-wife, Aviendha felt empowered to show her feelings for Rand once again. She is not certain what she thinks of a _second_ sister-wife in Min, but she seems to accept the idea at least. She has been having trouble learning Traveling again; the way Elayne forms the weave is different from how she used it to get to Seanchan, and it is difficult to learn something once you already learned it another way. She has, however, mastered the art of untying weaves—a feat which was thought impossible by all Aes Sedai, as well as the Forsaken. She and Elayne have adopted each other as first-sisters. Aviendha has a special ability in making wards against eavesdropping; it is unlikely even the Forsaken could breach one of her wards, and certainly no one could do so without her knowing it immediately. Aviendha was staying with Elayne at the Royal Palace in Caemlyn, but she was summoned away by the Wise Ones to complete her training. While in the Palace, she discovered a new Talent: the ability to sense the function of a _ter'angreal_ simply by holding it in her hands.

She refused two appointments to the Hall of the Tower, when refusing even once is unheard of. She also refused to become head of the Green Ajah.

She is somewhat of a living legend among Aes Sedai. According to [Min](#Elmindreda-Min-Farshaw), Cadsuane will teach [Rand](#Rand-al-Thor) and the Asha'man something—they will not like it, especially not from her, but they will have to learn it. She is the oldest Aes Sedai alive. Cadsuane wears many ornaments in her hair, all of which are _ter'angreal_ she has collected over the years—[Semirhage](#Semirhage) calls it a “paralis net.” One of them is a reservoir—it “stores” _saidar_ for later use in places where one might not be able to tap the Source, such as inside an Ogier _stedding_ or inside Far Madding, her hometown. Another vibrates in the presence of men who can channel; it is likely this ornament that has allowed her to capture so many men to be gentled. There are many others, including three that she does not know the purpose of. [Siuan](#Siuan-Sanche) suspects Cadsuane may be a Darkfriend, but based on her actions and thoughts so far that seems unlikely.

Despite being made of _cuendillar_, the three that remain unbroken can be cut with a knife and would break by a fall from a table. The Dark One is also referred to by other euphemisms, including Sightblinder, Lord of the Grave, Father of Lies, Grassburner, Leafblighter, Heartfang, Heartsbane, Soulsbane, Lord of the Twilight, Father of Storms, Shepherd of the Night, Soulblinder, and (among Darkfriends) the Great Lord of the Dark."

    "info": "Young woman from Emond's Field and daughter of the innkeeper there, now raised to the [Amyrlin Seat](#The-Amyrlin-Seat) among the Aes Sedai opposing [Elaida](#Elaida-do-Avriny-a-Roihan). She has considerable strength with the One Power, and will most likely be one of the strongest Aes Sedai in over a thousand years. She is also the first Dreamer in the Tower in almost 500 years; she trained with the Wise Ones to learn more of this Talent. Before her time with the Wise Ones, she was sold by [Liandrin](#Liandrin) to [Suroth](#High-Lady-Suroth-Sabelle-Meldarath) to be made _damane_. She was held captive under the name Tuli under care of the _sul'dam_ [Renna Emain](#Renna-Emain). When Egwene escaped, she left Renna with her _a'dam_ in place; the fact that Renna was bound by the _a'dam_ threatens to destroy the foundation of Seanchan society, especially their enslavement of women who can channel. Egwene is good friends with [Elayne Trakand](#Elayne-Trakand), the Daughter-Heir of Andor, and is also a childhood friend of [Rand al'Thor](#Rand-al-Thor), the [Dragon Reborn](#Dragon-Reborn). In fact, Rand and Egwene were all but Promised in their youth, but both of them feel an almost sibling-like love for each other now; they know that they cannot get married, and do not want to. Egwene is the love object of both of Elayne's brothers, [Galad](#Galadedrid-Galad-Damodred) and [Gawyn](#Gawyn-Trakand)—she is flattered by Galad's attentions, but she does not return them. She does find Gawyn to her liking, and had a dream of bonding him as her Warder; she knows it will occur. Egwene was most likely chosen Amyrlin because she was in the Aiel Waste when the rebellion occurred, and because the Aes Sedai thought she could be manipulated by them without too much trouble; if this was their intent, they made a grave mistake, for Egwene promises to be one of the strongest Amyrlins in history. Egwene has enlisted [Gareth Bryne](#Gareth-Bryne) as the commander of her army to invade Tar Valon and remove [Elaida](#Elaida-do-Avriny-a-Roihan) from power. She has also opened the novice books to all interested women for the first time in history—in the past, they were only open to girls of a certain age, for fear that older women would not be able to handle the discipline. This policy has increased the size of the rebel Tower to several times the size of the original, unified one. The number of novices has increased to levels not known for over a thousand years. Egwene has also discovered many lost Talents of the Age of Legends, such as Dreaming, Traveling, and the making of _cuendillar_. She was guided to Dreaming by the Wise Ones, with whom she studied in the Aiel Waste, and was guided to the making of _cuendillar_ by [Moghedien](#Moghedien) while she was captured, but Traveling was her discovery alone. She has recovered some other abilities through Moghedien as well. She plans to reunite the Tower and make it stronger than ever—and she plans to start by exiling Elaida, as she will not unite the Tower, only shatter it into fragments that will never be gathered up again. Egwene was captured by sisters loyal to Elaida after executing her plan to block the harbor by turning the harbor chain to _cuendillar_. She is now a prisoner in the Tower, and has been re-enlisted as a Novice again. She accepts all punishments Elaida and others impose upon her for insisting that she is still the Amyrlin Seat and still Aes Sedai. Her strong will and persistence have earned her the respect of nearly all the novices and perhaps several of the Accepted as well. Egwene plans to subvert Elaida from the inside by making suggestions and hinting that various things Elaida has done are indefinsible; she speaks to anyone that seems willing to ponder those suggestions. More urgently, Egwene is attempting to convince the Hall—both the Hall in Tar Valon and the Hall in Exile—that they must be prepared for the Seanchan attack she knows is imminent."

    "chapter": "Chapter 1: Tears from Steel",
    "info": "Aes Sedai formerly of the Red Ajah, now raised to the [Amyrlin Seat](#The-Amyrlin-Seat) in Tar Valon. She was born the youngest daughter of a minor House in the north of Murandy. She occasionally has the Foretelling, and as a result of a Foretelling she had concerning the importance of the Royal Family of Andor in Tarmon Gaidon, she served as advisor to [Queen Morgase](#Morgase-Trakand) of Andor for her entire reign. She later led the coup that deposed [Siuan Sanche](#Siuan-Sanche) and placed herself on the Amyrlin Seat in Siuan's place. She distrusts anyone not of the Red Ajah (as most Reds do), and does not think she will ever be able to trust any member of the Blue Ajah again. Her [Keeper of the Chronicles](#Keeper-of-the-Chronicles) was [Alviarin Freidhen](#Alviarin-Freidhen) of the White Ajah—she was all but forced to choose Alviarin due to her role in the deposition of Siuan. If she chose a Keeper from her Ajah, she most likely would not have won the support of the White Ajah, and then _she_ would have been stilled and banished from the Tower instead of Siuan. Her Foretelling about the importance of Andor's royal family during the Last Battle occurred around the time the Succession was going on, so she immediately attached herself to Morgase as soon as it became clear that she would be the one to take the Lion Throne. Another of her Foretellings was to predict that [Rand al'Thor](#Rand-al-Thor) would shake the world on its very foundations—she constantly kicks herself for not doing something about him when he was right in front of her, little more than a farmboy at the time. Her most recent Foretelling was that “the White Tower would be whole again, except for remnants cast out and scorned, whole and stronger than ever. [Rand al'Thor](#Rand-al-Thor) will face the Amyrlin Seat and know her anger. The Black Tower will be rent in blood and fire, and sisters will walk its grounds.” The Foretelling about Rand is obviously deadly accurate. However, the one about the Royal Family occurred at an inopportune time; at the time of Elaida's Foretelling, the Royal Family was not certain. It may have meant Morgase, [Gawyn](#Gawyn-Trakand), [Galad](#Galadedrid-Galad-Damodred), and [Elayne](#Elayne-Trakand) (they have all had a large role to play in the recent past), but it is also possible it could have meant the old Royal Family, that of [Tigraine](#Lady-Tigraine-Mantear), [Taringail](#Taringail-Damodred), Galad, and later Elayne and Gawyn as well. After all, Morgase is just Morgase, but Tigraine is the mother of the [Dragon Reborn](#Dragon-Reborn). Her most recent Foretelling will of course be fulfilled, but not necessarily how she wants it to be; she does not realize that the Amyrlin Seat in the Foretelling might not be her, that the remnants cast out might be those loyal to her, and that the destruction of the Black Tower might have nothing to do with her. Elaida is quite strong in the One Power; only Siuan (before she was still and Healed), [Moiraine](#Moiraine-Damodred), [Egwene](#Egwene-al-Vere), [Elayne](#Elayne-Trakand), [Nynaeve](#el-Nynaeve-ti-al-Meara-Mandragoran), and a few others could match her strength. Elaida has always sought positions of power; she chose to follow Morgase to have a better chance at guiding the forces in the Last Battle, and tried to capture Rand al'Thor in an effort to gain similar control. The only sisters that support her are those that are actually Black Ajah and those that would follow any Amyrlin legally raised, as Elaida was (although just barely; all laws used to raise her were stretched almost to their breaking point, and some believe they actually _did_ shatter). Elaida is currently building a palace for herself atop the Warders' old practice yard. The building will be about as tall as the White Tower. She has no plans on being merciful on those who rebelled against her when she deposed Siuan—her terms are that the Blue Ajah no longer exists, and that any sister following Egwene must serve penance under her personal guidance before being readmitted to the Tower. Elaida has since replaced Alviarin as Keeper with a sister of the Red Ajah, Tarna Feir, and she has suspicions that Alviarin was trying to commit treason against the Tower. She ordered [Seaine Herimon](#Seaine-Herimon) to “follow the trail of treason” as far as it went, even to the Keeper herself. Seaine interpreted this as a charge to capture members of the Black Ajah, leading to a grave situation for Seaine, as she now has several Black sisters that she has uncovered and no longer feels she can trust Elaida."

Later, when she and Nynaeve had trouble with [Moghedien](#Moghedien), Elayne ended up bonding Birgitte as her Warder (despite being only Accepted at the time) in order to save Birgitte's life. Elayne later went to Ebou Dar and found the Bowl of the Winds, a _ter'angreal_ that they used to fix the weather. She has since returned to Andor upon hearing news of her mother's disappearance; she plans to take the Lion Throne, as soon as she has garnered enough support to keep it. She recently ended Arymilla's campaign for the Throne, which convinced all but one of the necessary nobles to support her for the Lion Throne. During that campaign, Elayne was captured by the Black Ajah, though Birgitte convinced the Windfinders to help rescue her. In the mean time, Elayne has managed to reproduce several _ter'angreal_, something which no one else has been able to do since the Breaking of the World, as well as discover a way to share a Warder bond between three women; she bonded Rand along with Aviendha, her new sister by Aiel tradition, and Min. Shortly after bonding Rand, she became pregnant with Rand's twins. To protect the children, she is not revealing the father of the twins. She is the first ruler of Andor to _ever_ cede land to anyone: she agreed with the Sea Folk to cede a few square miles of Andor to them in exchange for their help feeding the city during the siege. She also sends Andoran troops to the Black Tower (which is on Andoran soil) periodically to remind its inhabitants that they are still within Andor and subject to its laws. She is proving to be a capable leader, one her people may eventually be quite proud of."

She has a special ability that few besides herself know about: she sees images and auras around people, especially around Aes Sedai, Warders, and Asha'man, that foretell their futures. Min does not always know what these viewings mean, but when she does, it _will_ happen; it is only a question of how and when. Min was fascinated by the number of images she saw around [Rand](#Rand-al-Thor), especially the one she saw that included herself: he was destined to fall in love with three different women, one of which was herself. She usually dressed in attire reserved for men; this habit was picked up when growing up with her father, who was a miner. However, once she started to develop feelings for Rand, she began to wear more traditionally feminine attire—still coat and trousers, but cut to emphasize female characteristics. Min was in Tar Valon helping [Siuan](#Siuan-Sanche) with her viewings' information when Siuan was deposed, and it was Min that freed Siuan and [Leane](#Leane-Sharif) from the dungeon. She accompanied the two former leaders of the Aes Sedai to Salidar; once there, she left for Caemlyn with Salidar's embassy to Rand. Once in Caemlyn, she brought information to Rand about the embassy there, and its intentions. She has only had one viewing that ever failed, which concerned [Moiraine](#Moiraine-Damodred); since Moiraine is believed dead, she hopes that her viewings might be wrong at least once in a while.

She is the daughter of [Davram](#Lord-Davram-t-Ghaline-Bashere) and [Deira](#Deira-ni-Ghaline-t-Bashere) Bashere, their oldest surviving offspring. Her two older brothers were killed, and when Davram sent her younger brother off to fight while keeping her at home, she ran away and swore the oath of a Hunter of the Horn in Illian. When she became a Hunter, she renounced her old name, Zarine, at first considering adopting the name “Mandarb”—she chose Faile when she found that Mandarb was the name of [Lan](#al-Lan-Mandragoran)'s horse. She fell in love with [Perrin Aybara](#Perrin-t-Bashere-Aybara) while on her search for the Horn, who told her that the Horn had been found. She was shocked, but even more so to find out that [Rand](#Rand-al-Thor) was the [Dragon Reborn](#Dragon-Reborn) and that both he and Perrin are _ta'veren_. Faile stayed near Perrin, and finally accompanied him to the Two Rivers where she helped fend off the Trolloc attacks; the two were married shortly afterwards. They were then proclaimed Lord and Lady of the Two Rivers. Perrin hated the idea, but Faile insisted they have a modest estate, and even servants, which she trained herself. Her name means “falcon” in the Old Tongue; she is the falcon in [Min](#Elmindreda-Min-Farshaw)'s viewings of Perrin. She is very protective of her blacksmith, and does whatever she can to make sure he not so much as _looks_ at another woman, even though he has no intention of doing so. She is a very jealous wife, especially toward people like [Berelain](#Berelain-sur-Paendrag-Paeron) who eye her husband all the time. She even cornered [Min](#Elmindreda-Min-Farshaw) when they first came to Caemlyn and Perrin greeted her warmly, to make sure Min had no intentions toward him. She left with Perrin for Ghealdan to find [Masema](#Masema-Dagar), and while he was away her party was ambushed by the Shaido Aiel and she was taken _gai'shain_ by them. She and the servants captured with her attempted to escape, but were betrayed by [Galina Casban](#Galina-Casban). She was now a personal servant of [Sevanna](#Sevanna), and she seemed to be one of Sevanna's favorites—for both service and punishment. She is a natural leader, even earning the respect and obedience of [Alliandre](#Queen-Alliandre-Maritha-Kigarin), the Queen of Ghealdan, and [Morgase](#Morgase-Trakand), the former Queen of Andor (though she does not know Morgase's true identity). Alliandre, Morgase, and Faile were rescued by the _Mera'din_, the Brotherless, Aiel men traveling with the Shaido when the left the Three-Fold Land. Their rescue coincided with Perrin's attack on the Shaido encampment, resulting in the deaths of many of the Aielmen. Now that she has been rescued, Faile has taken it upon herself to do the things her husband is unable or unwilling to do—first among them, killing [Masema](#Masema-Dagar), the [Prophet](#The-Prophet-of-the-Dragon)."

He was appointed to the position because Morgase had no living male relatives, but was exiled from Caemlyn on a suggestion from Morgase's new advisor, [Lord Gaebril](#Lord-Gaebril). He moved to his private estates in rural Andor, where he later presided over the trial of three young women who unintentionally burned a barn: they turned out to be [Siuan Sanche](#Siuan-Sanche), the former [Amyrlin Seat](#The-Amyrlin-Seat); [Leane Sharif](#Leane-Sharif), the former [Keeper of the Chronicles](#Keeper-of-the-Chronicles), and [Min Farshaw](#Elmindreda-Min-Farshaw). When these three made an oath to serve him and then apparently broke it, he followed them out of sheer curiosity to Salidar. Once there, he discovered the true identity of the three, as well as that the Tower was truly broken. The Aes Sedai in Salidar persuaded him to command the army they would need to take the Amyrlin Seat from [Elaida](#Elaida-do-Avriny-a-Roihan), since he was the only commander that the Warders thought would be willing and able to help them. He is one of the six best military commanders west of the Aiel Waste, in a league with Pedron Niall, [Rodel Ituralde](#Lord-Rodel-Ituralde), [Davram Bashere](#Lord-Davram-t-Ghaline-Bashere), Agelmar Jagad, and [Matrim Cauthon](#Matrim-Mat-Cauthon). Although neither of them would admit it, Bryne seems to be developing feelings for Siuan Sanche; he wishes to avoid another mistake like his relationship as [Morgase](#Morgase-Trakand)'s lover, and also never forgave Siuan for when she publicly shamed him years ago. She seems to be developing similar feelings for him, much to her dismay. He plans to be the first general to take the city of Tar Valon; the closest anyone else has ever come was with Guaire Amalasan's armies, who got as far as the White Tower itself, and [Artur Hawkwing](#High-King-Artur-Hawkwing), who never managed to go beyond beseiging the city. Actually, Amalasan's troops never beseiged the city, they simply managed to breech the walls; Hawkwing never managed to stop the supply ships coming up the river. Bryne thought he would be able to overcome this problem by purchasing ships along the way to Tar Valon, but when [Egwene](#Egwene-al-Vere) brought the entire army to Tar Valon by Traveling, that plan faltered; instead, he pressured her to let him use gateways to breach the walls and get inside the city. He is stocky, with a bluff face. The years have given him some sort of comforting calmness. Men always follow him—they have learned from history that doing so is the path to military victory. Bryne taught [Galad](#Galadedrid-Galad-Damodred) and [Gawyn](#Gawyn-Trakand) to practice the sword with both hands alternating to avoid weakness. Bryne is currently besieging the city of Tar Valon."

During the chaos that erupted after [Siuan Sanche](#Siuan-Sanche)'s deposition, Gawyn formed a band of young men, everyone who had trained with the Warders except Galad, who are called the Younglings. The Younglings fought back against their teachers, who were trying to free Siuan and [Leane](#Leane-Sharif) from their imprisonment. Gawyn himself killed [Hammar](#Hammar) and [Coulin](#Coulin), the men in charge of teaching the sword and for his personal training, respectively, both of which were Blademasters—few Warders are as good as they were, and Gawyn managed to kill both of them. With recent developments, Gawyn does not know which party to support—he believes that anyone who opposed Tower Law by trying to free Siuan and Leane was wrong, but at the same time he does not know all the facts surrounding the change in leadership. In fact, his sister Elayne and her friends [Nynaeve al'Meara](#el-Nynaeve-ti-al-Meara-Mandragoran) and [Egwene al'Vere](#Egwene-al-Vere) side with those who broke from the Tower, and Egwene, the woman he wants to marry, is their new leader. He believes the rumor that [Rand](#Rand-al-Thor) killed his mother, and only refrains from killing him because Egwene made him promise not to. Gawyn has made many enemies inside and outside the Tower, just by leading the Younglings. He detests Rand because he thinks Rand killed his mother, and there is no telling how he'll react when he finds out that Elayne actually does love Rand. Gawyn currently leads the Younglings on harrying parties against the army besieging Tar Valon; he is starting to think that [Elaida](#Elaida-do-Avriny-a-Roihan) is merely sending him on missions to keep him out of her hair, so to speak. At one time, he had no problem with the fact that he had killed his former teachers—they were rebelling against a lawfully raised Amyrlin—but he has since begun to feel guilty, wondering if he had truly chosen the just side. He has stated that he did not like Elaida—she had always been cold to him as his mother's advisor—but he supported her because he disliked what Siuan had done, involving Egwene and Elayne in her plotting.

His armies put down those of Guaire Amalasan, a false [Dragon](#The-Dragon), and he even sent troops across the Aryth Ocean under his son, [Luthair Paendrag Mondwhin](#Luthair-Paendrag-Mondwhin), in hopes of conquering new lands there.

Alviarin has since been deposed and replaced by Tarna Feir of the Red Ajah."

She and another Aes Sedai named Beidomon bored into the prison, creating what is now referred to as simply the Bore, allowing the Dark One to touch the world again and leading to the War of the Shadow. Around this time, Mierin formed a relationship with [Lews Therin Telamon](#Lews-Therin-Telamon), who headed the forces of the Light against the Shadow and was the most powerful man she had found.

She was later Healed by [Nynaeve](#el-Nynaeve-ti-al-Meara-Mandragoran), and restored to some of her former capacity for using the One Power. The Hall of the Tower in Salidar decided that since she had been stilled, she was no longer Aes Sedai for that time and thus all of her titles and choice of Ajah were null and void. Instead of petitioning to re-enter the Blue Ajah, she asked the Green Ajah if it would accept her; it did, and she became the first sister to ever switch Ajahs. Her eyes-and-ears as Keeper are retained by her; she was the only Aes Sedai to plant spies in the city itself. These spies were very useful in determining both what is going on in Tar Valon and what the Ajahs were leaving out of their reports to [Egwene](#Egwene-al-Vere).

Loial was constantly afraid that his mother would find him and try to marry him off and settle him down; however, he does like his mother's choice of wives for him, Erith. He, like most of the Ogier, is sad that most humans do not remember the Ogier, and is horrified that some even think he is a Trolloc on first seeing him. Loial's mother did indeed catch up with him; he and Erith are now married. He was last seen on his way back to Stedding Shangtai to speak to the Stump. Loial is taking notes for a book, which will eventually catalog everything he has been through with the three _ta'veren_."

Along with his good friends, [Rand al'Thor](#Rand-al-Thor) and [Perrin Aybara](#Perrin-t-Bashere-Aybara), he left home to escape the Trolloc attacks after Winternight. On the way to Tar Valon, he picked up a dagger from Shadar Logoth tainted with the evil that destroyed Aridhol, which he carried with him for a long time. He was separated from the dagger by Aes Sedai Healing, but doing so caused large gaps in his memory sequence. These gaps were filled and more when he passed through the twisted door to the land of the Eelfinn, where he was granted his three requests: a foxhead medallion that protects him from women's channeling, a way out of the land of the Eelfinn, and the memories of past lifetimes that were the gaps in his memory. Mat's _ta'veren_ qualities manifest themselves particularly well with random events, such as dice games—he almost never loses a toss of the dice, even if the dice are weighted. He has found that battles are the ultimate form of gambling, and along with his newfound memories he can win almost every battle he fights quite decisively. He has four sisters, including Eldrin and Bodewhin, who were 16 and 17, respectively, when Mat left Emond's Field. His father Abell is one of the best archers in the Two Rivers, possibly in the World. Mat has gotten in the habit of carrying concealed knives under his clothes in case he is attacked—his collection would surprise anyone. In the Waste, he met a woman named Melindhra, a Maiden of the Spear from the Shaido Clan. However, she was not the [Daughter of the Nine Moons](#Daughter-of-the-Nine-Moons), who Mat is destined to marry according to the Aelfinn; besides, she tried to kill him on orders from her master among the Darkfriends. Mat had to kill her to save his own skin, but regretted it deeply. He also has a scar along his neck from where the Eelfinn tried to kill him—which was also in accordance with what the Aelfinn told him, that he is “to die and live again.” He created an army called the Band of the Red Hand, after the army of King Aemon of old Manetheren, and served in a way as Rand's personal general—this worked well, since Mat seems to be a better general than even [Davram Bashere](#Lord-Davram-t-Ghaline-Bashere), who has earned his reputation as one of the best commanders alive. Mat does not trust any Aes Sedai, and because of this refuses to take his foxhead medallion off even to take a bath. Mat went to Ebou Dar to try to keep an eye on [Elayne](#Elayne-Trakand) and [Nynaeve](#el-Nynaeve-ti-al-Meara-Mandragoran) and prevent them from getting themselves killed. While there, he was cornered by [Queen Tylin](#Queen-Tylin-Quintara-Mitsobar), who gave him little choice but to become her lover. When the Sea Folk and the Seanchan did battle in the city, he made his escape, leaving Tylin tied up under the bed so it looked “official”—Tylin was found torn limb from limb, obviously by the _gholam_ which was no doubt sent to kill Mat. In the process of leaving, Mat also took several _sul'dam_ and _damane_ (who were subsequently freed from their collars), and even kidnapped [Tuon](#High-Lady-Tuon-Athaem-Kore-Paendrag), the [Daughter of the Nine Moons](#Daughter-of-the-Nine-Moons) herself. Mat traveled with Valan Luca's show to keep out of Seanchan sight for quite some time. Tuon has now completed Mat's unwitting marriage ceremony; he is now among the highest of the Seanchan ruling class, despite his insistence that he will fight the Seanchan during any battle if such battle is necessary."

Taim claims to have held off the madness that normally accompanies the taint for almost 35 years—he has been using the One Power for a very long time, and knows many tricks that Rand had not thought of on his own or been taught by [Asmodean](#Asmodean), such as how to test men for the ability. He seems to resent being second to Rand, and also gave orders to kill Rand. He is almost as tall as Rand, has a hooked nose and dark eyes. He is a physically powerful and graceful man, although his skill with a sword is lacking. He gives special training to about 20 or 30 men—they are the only ones who wear the dragon besides [Logain](#Logain-Ablar). There is also little doubt that every last one of them is a Darkfriend, as is Taim."

She is considered short among her people, and the Cairhienin are already a short people. When it was discovered that she had the ability to channel inborn, Moiraine went to Tar Valon to become an Aes Sedai. Just before being raised to the shawl, she and her friend [Siuan Sanche](#Siuan-Sanche) witnessed Gitara Moroso's Foretelling of the Rebirth of the [Dragon](#The-Dragon). Moiraine and Siuan walked away from each other and did not speak to each other again (at least in public), but both held secret communication with each other and dedicated their lives to finding and guiding the [Dragon Reborn](#Dragon-Reborn). Moiraine found the young man she sought on Winternight in Emond's Field, a young man named [Rand al'Thor](#Rand-al-Thor), along with two more _ta'veren_, [Mat Cauthon](#Matrim-Mat-Cauthon) and [Perrin Aybara](#Perrin-t-Bashere-Aybara), and two women with the spark of the Power inborn, [Egwene al'Vere](#Egwene-al-Vere) and [Nynaeve al'Meara](#el-Nynaeve-ti-al-Meara-Mandragoran). When Moiraine was shortly raised to the shawl, she met [al'Lan Mandragoran](#al-Lan-Mandragoran), the uncrowned King of Malkier, who was fighting alone against the Shadow in the Borderlands; she eventually asked Lan to become her Warder, and he accepted. She is very strong in the Power, stronger than almost all living Aes Sedai before Egwene and Nynaeve came to the Tower. In the Stone of Tear, Moiraine confronted and killed the Forsaken Be'lal with balefire, just before he would have killed Rand. Later, after having an inkling of the future events from the testing _ter'angreal_ for the Wise Ones, Moiraine managed to push the Forsaken [Lanfear](#Lanfear) through the twisted doorway _ter'angreal_ into the land of the Eelfinn, trapping both her and Lanfear there. Moiraine is the subject of the only viewing [Min](#Elmindreda-Min-Farshaw) has ever had that has not come true. Min assumes it _cannot_ come true, as Moiraine is dead, though she has not said yet what the viewing said she needed to do—only that Rand would almost certainly fail without her. According to a letter Moiraine wrote to [Thom Merrilin](#Thomdril-Thom-Merrilin) the day before her death, however, she lives on in the land of the Finn, but her bond with Lan has been severed. The same letter convinced [Mat](#Matrim-Mat-Cauthon) to help Thom rescue her, though her vision in the _ter'angreal_ apparently indicated disaster would result unless Mat _asked_ to see the letter before Thom showed it to him. Other Aes Sedai consider Moiraine a legend, not only for discovering the [Dragon Reborn](#Dragon-Reborn) but for defeating two of the Forsaken as well. Despite her efforts, and for the most part, success, [Cadsuane](#Cadsuane-Melaidhrin) still thinks she “bungled” things with Rand."

She married [Taringail Damodred](#Taringail-Damodred), a prince of Cairhien, to further solidify her claim to the Throne of Andor and keep peace between the two nations; when [Tigraine](#Lady-Tigraine-Mantear) disappeared, Morgase made the best claim to succeed her, and married her widower to gain the support that would be gained by such action. Taringail was Elayne's and Gawyn's father; he died when they were young. Morgase has since gone through several lovers, including [Thomdril Merrilin](#Thomdril-Thom-Merrilin), a former court-bard; [Gareth Bryne](#Gareth-Bryne), her First Prince of the Sword and Captain of the Guards; and most recently [Lord Gaebril](#Lord-Gaebril), a man who led the faction that stilled the riots in Caemlyn that sprang up on Morgase's trip to Tar Valon to inquire about Elayne's whereabouts. Thom was exiled from the city of Caemlyn when he started telling her what he really thought of some of her plans, her relationship with Bryne ebbed away until finally Gaebril told her to exile him too, and Gaebril eventually chased Morgase herself out of the city when she found he was usurping her power. The Daughter-Heir of Andor is traditionally trained by Aes Sedai in the White Tower, and Morgase underwent novice training to keep the tradition alive. She was given the gift of a Great Serpent ring despite not being Accepted, and still wears it on her left hand. She was previously advised by [Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan](#Elaida-do-Avriny-a-Roihan) of the Red Ajah, who is now the [Amyrlin Seat](#The-Amyrlin-Seat) in Tar Valon. When Morgase discovered that Gaebril (who, unbeknownst to her, was actually [Rahvin](#Rahvin)) meant to usurp her throne, she left, and when she learned that the [Dragon Reborn](#Dragon-Reborn) had taken over Caemlyn and none of her former supporters would give her aid, she fled to Amadicia to get help from the only place she thought she could: Pedron Niall and the Children of the Light. She was not aware that [Rand](#Rand-al-Thor) only wanted to give her country back to her, not to mention believes that she is dead. If she had made her presence known, she would no doubt have had her country back in one piece, but as royalty she believed she must work on her own and trust no one. She went into hiding after the Seanchan attack ([Eamon Valda](#Lord-Captain-Commander-Eamon-Valda) believes her to be dead) under her mother's first name, Maighdin to avoid instant recognition, and later became a maidservant to [Faile](#Faile-ni-Bashere-t-Aybara); she told Faile that she was a lady's handmaid before coming into her service. When Faile's group was captured, she became a prisoner of the Shaido, and is now detained in their encampment. Her sign is three golden keys. A former member of the Queen's Guard, Martyn Tallanvor, has taken a liking to his former queen, and she finds herself almost unconsciously returning his attentions. Her adopted son [Galad](#Galadedrid-Galad-Damodred) believes her dead at the hands of Eamon Valda, and plans revenge on him. Her son Gawyn believes her dead at the hands of the [Dragon Reborn](#Dragon-Reborn), and is only restrained from killing her by [Egwene](#Egwene-al-Vere)'s command. Her daughter Elayne believes her dead as well (though she as yet has no plans for vengeance), and her new mistress Faile has no idea of her true identity."

Instead, he attempts to keep everything in chaos (as per the [Dark One](#Dark-One)'s command, “Let the Lord of Chaos Rule”), hoping that subtle manipulations will further his goals.

Their two streams of balefire crossed, causing both of their heads to ring, and ever since then there has been a link between Moridin and Rand that Moridin does not completely understand and Rand seems unaware exists.

She used the fact that she could Foretell to be even more arrogant and demand even more special treatment. When Egwene refused to grant her that treatment, she ran away to the White Tower, thinking they would let her progress at the pace she wanted. She could not have been more incorrect, of course, and her life in the Tower is no doubt even more abysmal than it was before. It will get even worse if a sister ever finds out that she lied about her age; she is too old to be entered into the novice book by traditional Tower law. When Egwene was captured, Nicola became one of her foremost adherents among the novices; Nicola has gathered enough support for Egwene amongst the novices that they support Egwene more than many of the sisters in the Tower."

Elyas, a former Warder who found he could talk to wolves, helped Perrin discover the same ability in himself. Perrin's eyes are now yellow, just like the wolves' eyes, and he can enter what he calls the Wolf Dream (known to most as _Tel'aran'rhiod_, the World of Dreams) with them. Perrin is a childhood friend of fellow _ta'veren_ [Rand al'Thor](#Rand-al-Thor) and [Mat Cauthon](#Matrim-Mat-Cauthon). On the way to Tear, Perrin encountered a young woman by the name of Zarine Bashere, a Hunter for the Horn who took the name of [Faile](#Faile-ni-Bashere-t-Aybara) (which means “Falcon” in the Old Tongue) as a more appropriate name for a Hunter for the Horn. The two are now married. Perrin is a very large man—he was always a big person, which caused him to be very cautious since he found as a child that he could easily hurt other children if his temper got out of hand. His size helped considerably when helping [Master Luhhan](#Haral-Luhhan) on his forge, but sometimes gave others the impression that he is slow and stupid. He returned to the Two Rivers for a time to repel the series of Trolloc attacks; he and his wife are recognized as Lord and Lady there, the first noblility of the Two Rivers since the Trolloc Wars. When he returned, he began to draw the eye of [Berelain sur Paendrag Paeron](#Berelain-sur-Paendrag-Paeron), the First of Mayene—Perrin wants nothing more than to be as far from her as possible, but Berelain will not take no for an answer, much to Faile's dismay and intense jealousy. Perrin was instrumental in freeing Rand from his entrapment at Dumai's Wells; the two had a fight afterwards (they had planned it as a way for Perrin to leave, although they most likely did not plan on it being as violent as it was), and Perrin went to Ghealdan to see if he could tame [Masema](#Masema-Dagar). On the way, his wife was captured by Shaido, and he spent weeks single-mindedly trying to track her down. He eventually formed an alliance with [Tylee Khirgan](#Lieutenant-General-Tylee-Khirgan), a Seanchan Banner-General, to help him defeat the Shaido and free his wife.

He is very tall, with curly red-blond hair and bright blue-gray eyes that shine like gemstones. He was raised by [Tam al'Thor](#Tamlin-Tam-al-Thor) and his wife Kari (until her death around the time Rand was five) in Emond's Field. His real parents, however, were [Janduin](#Janduin), the chief of the Taardad Aiel who brought the four clans across the Dragonwall to punish [Laman](#Laman-Damodred)'s Sin, and a Maiden of the Spear named Shaiel, who was actually [Tigraine Mantear](#Lady-Tigraine-Mantear), the runaway Daughter-Heir of Andor. Tigraine gave birth to Rand on the slopes of Dragonmount, in accordance with prophecy; “born of a Maiden, of the ancient blood but raised by the Old.” Rand had a heron branded into each of his palms, which he received from the sword Tam gave him while fighting [Ishamael](#Ishamael). He also has two dragons on his forearms, which he received in Rhuidean to designate him as the _[Car'a'carn](#Car-a-carn)_, the Chief of Chiefs of the Aiel. He has recently taken to wearing a new sword: curved, with a black scabbard, painted with two twisting dragons much like those on his forearms. It was found under a submerged statue. He is not only the Dragon Reborn, but also He Who Comes With the Dawn, the man prophesied to reunite the Aiel, and the [Coramoor](#Coramoor), the one prophesied to bring the Sea Folk out of the Sea. He can channel strongly, more so than any person who ever lived (except the previous user of his soul, [Lews Therin Telamon](#Lews-Therin-Telamon), who was obviously of equal strength), and is also _ta'veren_, the most strongly so since Lews Therin as well. Lews Therin's voice has somehow found a new place inside of Rand's head; he talks to him in a mad voice when Rand least expects it, sometimes offering sound advice or knowledge, sometimes babbling, sometimes even trying to wrest control of _saidin_ from him. Unlike Lews Therin, Rand is accompanied by two other _ta'veren_ during his turing of the Wheel, two men born within days (hours, even) of him named [Matrim Cauthon](#Matrim-Mat-Cauthon) and [Perrin Aybara](#Perrin-t-Bashere-Aybara), who both grew up in Emond's Field as well. Rand is destined to fall in love with three women (and has): [Min Farshaw](#Elmindreda-Min-Farshaw), [Elayne Trakand](#Elayne-Trakand), and [Aviendha](#Aviendha). Rand has had success in fighting many of the Forsaken; all to confront him have died or been trapped. He killed Aginor at the Eye of the World after the Green Man killed Balthamel; he allowed [Moiraine](#Moiraine-Damodred) to kill Be'lal in the Stone of Tear, and killed [Ishamael](#Ishamael) in the Stone shortly afterward; in the wagons near the Spine of the World, [Lanfear](#Lanfear) confronted him and was pushed into the land of the Eelfinn by Moiraine; he killed [Rahvin](#Rahvin) in _Tel'aran'rhiod_ when he came to the Royal Palace in Caemlyn; [Asmodean](#Asmodean), his teacher, was killed shortly after Rahvin met his fate; [Sammael](#Sammael) met his fate while fighting Rand in Shadar Logoth at the hands of Mashadar; Osan'gar, the reincarnation of Aginor, died at Shador Logoth when Rand was cleansing _saidin_; and [Semirhage](#Semirhage) was captured during her attempt to capture Rand and bind him with a male _a'dam_. During his duel with Sammael, Rand encountered a mysterious wanderer, presumably [Moridin](#Moridin), who helped him. During the fighting, their streams of balefire collided, causing Rand's head to spin and both of them to lose coherency for a while. Ever since that time, Rand has had trouble seizing _saidin_; it is not known if this is because of Moridin's presumed use of the True Power, or something else. During his fight with Semirhage, Rand had his hand burned away by her weave of Fire; Moridin has since been seen favoring his left hand, as if Rand's injury is somehow affecting him. Since the hand cannot be repaired, Rand has moved on without it—others have compared it to the reaction one might have after losing a glove. Rand has steeled himself to do what he must, without emotional influence, without distraction from feelings. Rand's prophecies fulfilled grow: he has already been born on the slopes of Dragonmount of a Maiden, of the ancient blood but raised by the old, taken the Stone of Tear and drawn _Callandor_, and began conquering “under the forgotten symbol,” that of the Aes Sedai of the Age of Legends. He is working on having the “spotless tower” (i.e., the White Tower) break and bend knee to him (the Tower has broken, and several Aes Sedai have sworn fealty to him and only him). He recently used the Choedan Kal, the two great _sa'angreal_ created during the War of the Shadow, to cleanse the [Dark One](#Dark-One)'s taint from _saidin_. He has created schools of sorts, more research universities, where some of the best inventors of the day have congregated near Cairhien, Caemlyn, and Tear to develop new technology. Rand has also created the Asha'man, men who came for his “amnesty” for male channelers. With _saidin_ cleansed, the Asha'man are now safe from the [Dark One](#Dark-One)'s taint. The Asha'man themselves are not free from the Dark One's _influence_, however; there are many Darkfriends among the Asha'man, including [Mazrim Taim](#Mazrim-Taim), the leader of the Black Tower. The Asha'man under Taim have turned on Rand, trying to kill him and worse, though Rand does not at this point know that they were acting with Taim's knowledge. Rand is under _considerable_ stress at the moment—he has made it a point to make himself harder, believing that emotionlessness is the key to surviving to do what he must do. Rand is the salvation of the entire world, and as the prophecy states, he _will_ save the world—and Break it again."

Most thought the pain or anguish she exacted from them was a small price to pay for being alive, but eventually the Hall of Servants found out about her practices and gave her the choice of being either severed or bound with the Power, never again to know her “pleasures.” She chose instead to pledge for the [Dark One](#Dark-One), and created one of the most oppressive and pain-filled areas of Shadow control during the entire War of Power. She became an expert at sadism and torture; she considers her greatest achievement to be a weave which removes the victim's blood and replaces it, instantaneously, with another liquid that causes every nerve in the body to fire with pain simultaneously—the victims typically survived about an hour. After being freed from the Bore, Semirhage went in service to the Dark One by extracting information from captured Borderlanders and Aes Sedai.

Born in Tear to a fisherman, she was sent to the White Tower on the first boat to leave after she discovered she had the ability to channel inborn, according to Tairen law. As a novice, she was good friends with [Moiraine Damodred](#Moiraine-Damodred), and was present at Gitara Moroso's Foretelling of the Rebirth of the [Dragon](#The-Dragon). After being raised to the shawl, she joined the Blue Ajah to dedicate her life to finding and guiding the [Dragon Reborn](#Dragon-Reborn), and eventually came to lead the Blues' network of eyes-and-ears (i.e., spies) before being raised to the [Amyrlin Seat](#The-Amyrlin-Seat). She was only thirty years old when raised to the Amyrlin Seat, making her the youngest Amyrlin to that point. She was also one of the strongest Amyrlins in recent history, and one of the most feared among the rulers of nations. Her blue-eyed stare was feared by all. When her twenty-year connection to the [Dragon Reborn](#Dragon-Reborn) was discovered, she and her [Keeper of the Chronicles](#Keeper-of-the-Chronicles), [Leane Sharif](#Leane-Sharif), were deposed and stilled by a group of sisters loyal to [Elaida a'Roihan](#Elaida-do-Avriny-a-Roihan). Siuan hoped to regain some of her previous standing in the new Tower that separated from Elaida—her knowledge of the Blue Ajah spy network is hard to match, and she knows much that she thought would be of use. In one of her viewings, [Min](#Elmindreda-Min-Farshaw) saw that Siuan would have to remain close to [Gareth Bryne](#Gareth-Bryne)—if she did not, both of them would die. Siuan did not initially know what she meant, but now realizes that she is growing to love the gray-haired man who leads the rebel army. She had a Warder named [Alric](#Alric), but he was murdered by Elaida when Siuan was deposed. After coming to Salidar, [Nynaeve](#el-Nynaeve-ti-al-Meara-Mandragoran) discovered how to restore Siuan's ability to channel, at least partially. This resurrected a part of her bond with Alric, but did not bring back her former strength, or her binding by the Oath Rod. She can now lie as well as any child. She served as an advisor of sorts to the new Amyrlin in Salidar, [Egwene al'Vere](#Egwene-al-Vere), but though she put on a façade of hating the work, she is actually one of Egwene's foremost agents. The fact that she is Aes Sedai, not to mention one who was stilled and Healed again, makes other sisters tend to be oblivious to this fact. She was pushed very hard by Elaida as a novice. With Egwene being held prisoner in the Tower, Siuan has been charged with keeping the factions among the rebels—headed by [Romanda Cassin](#Romanda-Cassin) and [Lelaine Akashi](#Lelaine-Akashi), respectively—from usurping the rebellion and placing _themselves_ on the Amyrlin Seat."

The mayor's daughter argued for his life, convincing everyone that only Darkfriends would seek wounded Warders. The villagers hid him, and the girl nursed him to health.

Kings and queens of nations strong and weak will come if summoned by the Amyrlin, even if they spend their entire trip figuring out how they will put a knife in her back while there. The Seat is traditionally held by a woman strong both in the Power and in her character. The vote to choose an Amyrlin must be unanimous, as must the vote to depose one. Once chosen, the Amyrlin is said to be “of all Ajahs and none“—all previous affiliations with Ajah are ignored (at least in theory). The Ajahs have gotten fairly equal numbers of Amyrlins raised from their Ajah, with two exceptions. No Amyrlin had been raised from the Red Ajah since Bonwhin Meraighdin, who was deposed and stilled for nearly breaking the Tower in [Artur Hawkwing](#High-King-Artur-Hawkwing)'s day, except for [Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan](#Elaida-do-Avriny-a-Roihan), the current Amyrlin Seat in Tar Valon; the Blue Ajah has had more than the average number of Amyrlins from its Ajah—four of the last the last five Amyrlins (before Elaida) were raised from the Blue Ajah. These two exceptions to the mean number of Amyrlins from one's Ajah have only added to the friction between the Blue and Red Ajahs over the years. The Amyrlin has a secretary of sorts, the [Keeper of the Chronicles](#Keeper-of-the-Chronicles), who is traditionally chosen from the same Ajah that the Amyrlin was raised from. The Amyrlin Seat was held by [Siuan Sanche](#Siuan-Sanche), raised from the Blue Ajah, until she was deposed for her involvement with events surrounding the [Dragon Reborn](#Dragon-Reborn). Her successor was the leader of the coup, [Elaida do Avriny a'Roihan](#Elaida-do-Avriny-a-Roihan), raised from the Red Ajah. Siuan's deposition divided the Tower, and the faction opposing Elaida raised a new Amyrlin who could not be accused of choosing sides on the fateful day Siuan was deposed: [Egwene al'Vere](#Egwene-al-Vere), who was outside the Tower and not even a full sister from the time Siuan was deposed to the time Egwene was Raised.

Her Warder is named [Tomas](#Tomas). She is more interested in current events than the average Brown; most of them could not care less what happened now, only what happened years ago. She gave Egwene the twisted stone ring _ter'angreal_ to assist her in Dreaming, and also once told [Morgase](#Morgase-Trakand) that there was really no need to keep her in the Tower until she learned to control her ability when she was a novice, since she would never be able to do much with it anyway. When Verin went to the Two Rivers with [Alanna](#Alanna-Mosvani), they helped to fight the Trollocs that attacked, and when they left they brought a half-dozen young women with them who could channel, including [Mat](#Matrim-Mat-Cauthon)'s sister Bode. When she and Alanna reached Caemlyn, they found that the Tower had been broken, and decided to side with the Salidar embassy when it reached town. Verin is quite old—her hair is starting to turn gray, which to an Aes Sedai means she is quite old indeed. She communicated with [Cadsuane](#Cadsuane-Melaidhrin)'s group of sisters in Tear, but has since departed their company. Verin always seems to follow her own agenda, though [Siuan](#Siuan-Sanche) once said she had always trusted her, even though she knew she could trust no one. She and Tomas have been waiting for Mat for some time; she is the one who posted fliers of him and [Perrin](#Perrin-t-Bashere-Aybara) throughout the countryside, hoping to scare one of them up."

    "info": "The uncrowned king of Malkier, and formerly Warder to [Moiraine](#Moiraine-Damodred). He is quite tall, and does not get very emotional—in fact, he has emotional walls all around him that he has been building for years. His country, Malkier, was overrun by Trollocs shortly after he was born, and is now corrupted by the Great Blight. Lan, among the last of his people, then proceeded to fight a one-man war against the Shadow by killing Shadowspawn in the Blight. He fought Aiel during the Aiel War, and achieved Blademaster status. He was eventually bonded by Moiraine, which ended his lonely fight (or at least changed its style). When Lan and Moiraine brought [Rand](#Rand-al-Thor), [Mat](#Matrim-Mat-Cauthon), [Perrin](#Perrin-t-Bashere-Aybara), [Egwene](#Egwene-al-Vere), and [Nynaeve](#el-Nynaeve-ti-al-Meara-Mandragoran) out of their home in the Two Rivers, he found that there was something which could throw his guard down, but he was the last to notice it: affection for Nynaeve. As Moiraine put it, Nynaeve was able to plant vines in Lan's emotional walls and break them down without him even knowing they were there. The two of them are now married. According to the terms of their vows as taken before the Sea Folk, one of them must obey in public while the other obeys in private; for obvious reasons, Nynaeve is the one who commands in public. Upon Moiraine's death, Lan's bond was immediately transferred to [Myrelle](#Myrelle-Berengari) until Nynaeve is ready to have his bond transferred to her. Myrelle tried to keep Lan's status secret, but she was given away when she tried to buy one of Lan's favorite foods, coin peppers, too far south (they are very popular in Shienar, and were in Malkier before it fell to the Blight, but do not grow well in southern climates). Upon learning of where Lan was, [Egwene](#Egwene-al-Vere) sent him to Ebou Dar to serve as a Warder for Nynaeve. He traveled with his wife and the group of Aes Sedai she accompanies until he started to feel longing for his homeland. Nynaeve understood that he needed to finish his fight in the Blight, but she vowed to increase his chance of survival by dropping him off at World's End in Saldaea and alerting every surviving Malkieri she could find that Lan was marching for Tarwin's Gap. According to the Wise Ones, _Aan'allein_ (as the Aiel call him) will die the day he learns that Nynaeve is dead. He is one of the best, if not _the_ best, warriors, swordsmen, and Warders in the world."

    "chapter": "Prelude",
    "info": "Young woman from Emond's Field, now an Aes Sedai of the Yellow Ajah. She was the Wisdom of her village, the youngest such ever chosen in Emond's Field. She left when four of her villagers were taken away from the Two Rivers by [Moiraine](#Moiraine-Damodred) and [Lan](#al-Lan-Mandragoran). While the group traveled away from her home and toward her new life, Nynaeve made several discoveries: she could channel the One Power, and had already done so without really knowing what she was doing; she developed feelings for Lan Mandragoran, Moiraine's Warder and the uncrowned king of the now dead nation Malkier; and she has a major role to play, as all of her younger friends in the group do, in the years to come. She is very strong in the One Power; only a select few who were alive during the Age of Legends could match her as well as a few young women still being trained. When she arrived in Tar Valon, she was raised Accepted without any tenure as a novice, despite not being able to even _sense_ the True Source unless angry, a result of her having to learn some minimal control of her ability without teaching. She was sent on a false mission by [Liandrin](#Liandrin) on which she was almost leashed by the Seanchan as [Egwene](#Egwene-al-Vere) was. After she returned to the Tower, [Siuan Sanche](#Siuan-Sanche) sent her on a mission to hunt down Liandrin and her fellow Black Sisters; while hunting them in Tanchico, she encountered [Moghedien](#Moghedien) and managed to better her in a duel of the Power. Moghedien escaped, but two encounters later Nynaeve once again managed to get the better of her, leashing her with an _a'dam_ in _Tel'aran'rhiod_. Nynaeve took Moghedien with her to seek out [Rand](#Rand-al-Thor) and [Rahvin](#Rahvin) while they were fighting each other, and at the last moment before Rahvin might have won, she nearly burned Rahvin to ash with a giant weave of fire that was most of what Moghedien could draw to produce it; the distraction was enough for Rand to regain control of himself and destroy Rahvin with balefire. Nynaeve then kept Moghedien under control with a modified _a'dam_ in Salidar until [Halima](#Halima-Saranov) helped her escape. Nynaeve wished to become Aes Sedai for the sole purpose of Healing; she thinks the Tower meddles in the affairs of nations far too much, and wants no part of it. She is determined to Heal anything short of death, and has already managed to Heal gentling. Nynaeve felt bad when Moiraine died, because her first thought was not of her, but that now Lan was free from their bond. She was not told that Lan's bond had been passed to [Myrelle](#Myrelle-Berengari) at the moment of Moiraine's death. She and Lan are now married, and the plan is for Lan's bond to pass to her as soon as she and Myrelle can get together. She now wears the _ki'sain_, an ornament traditionally worn by Malkieri wives, consisting of a dot on the forehead between the eyes—Lan did not tell her of this tradition, but when she found out she immediately took it up. It is the one element of her appearance that never fades for one second when every other part changes faster than the eye can follow in _Tel'aran'rhiod_. Because she was the only person Rand felt he could trust to link with him and the Choedan Kal, he asked Nynaeve to assist him when he cleansed _saidin_. She now carries the _ter'angreal_ she found in Ebou Dar nearly all the time, making her collection of jewelry rival that of [Cadsuane](#Cadsuane-Melaidhrin). She is even rumored to leave much of this jewelry on even when sleeping."
